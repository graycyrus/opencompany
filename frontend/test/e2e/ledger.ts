 * The Finance surface folds `ledger.jsonl` and nothing else, and nothing in this
 * suite could put a line in it — the ledger fills from the inference cost hook,
 * which needs a real billed turn. So every Finance assertion until now ran
 * against an empty ledger, where the tile and the transaction list agree because
 * both are zero. That is the gap that let a whole-dollar tile ship over a
 * cent-precision list.
 *
 * This writes the same file the cost hook appends to, in the same shape
 * (`LedgerEntry` in `src/ports/types.rs`), so the host reads it through its own
 * projection with no test-only route in the way. `GET …/finances` loads the
 * record per request, so a seed lands on the next navigation.

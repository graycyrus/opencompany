/**
 * How a spec reaches each of the New-workflow dialog's two surfaces.
 *
 * The dialog used to be one thing: open it and the graph form was there, in
 * create mode, with every control on screen. It is now two, and which one you
 * get is decided by `createSurface` (`src/lib/workflow-create-surface.ts`):
 *
 * - **the one box** — a sentence and Create, on every create, on every company
 *   and every build. No Name, no Workflow ID, no Nodes, no Connections.
 * - **the graph form** — byte-for-byte the dialog that always existed, reached
 *   by an **edit**, and by a create the host **refused**.
 *
 * So "open the creator and fill in the fields" is no longer a route to
 * anything, and every spec that opened one used to reach the other. This module
 * is where the two routes are stated once rather than re-derived per spec — the
 * same reason `workflows.ts` exists for "how do I reach a workflow".
 *
 * ## Why some of these stub the host
 *
 * The suite runs in two lanes against two different hosts (`playwright.config.ts`):
 * a default-feature host, whose companies think with the offline `echo` brain,
 * and a feature-gated one thinking with `mock-brain.mjs`. The one box behaves
 * differently on each — one drafts, the other falls back to the operator's
 * sentence — and both are behaviours worth pinning, so the *cognition read* is
 * stubbed to name which one is under test rather than left to the lane.
 *
 * What is never stubbed is the **write**. Every helper here that creates a
 * workflow lets the real host store it, because "the console posted a graph the
 * host accepts" is the half a stub cannot tell you.

/**
 * Clears every first-run modal in the way, and waits until none is left.
 *
 * There are **two**, and both offer a button called "Skip for now": the
 * onboarding gate (`src/onboarding/OnboardingGate.tsx`), which gates the whole
 * shell until a company has cleared activation, and the welcome tour
 * (`src/tour/WelcomeDialog.tsx`). Which of them a company shows depends on how
 * it is staffed and wired, and a host can show both in turn.
 *
 * They are therefore dismissed by their own identities rather than by the name
 * they share. A helper that found "Skip for now" and clicked it hit the gate
 * mid-transition — Playwright reported "element is not stable", then "element
 * was detached from the DOM", which reads as a flaky click rather than as two
 * modals swapping places. Both overlays swallow pointer events, so the final
 * assertion is the one that matters: nothing is left to swallow the next click.

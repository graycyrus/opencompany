/**
 * Issue #583 — every tour stop's card must be reachable, at any window size.
 *
 * The reported symptom was "the tour is stuck at step 2", and the issue blamed
 * the step's target never mounting. It does mount. The card is rendered,
 * `visible`, `opacity: 1`, with working Skip/Next buttons — it is positioned
 * **off the top of the viewport**, measured on staging at `y = -238` for a card
 * 222px tall. Nothing about it is reachable, so the tour reads as vanished.
 *
 * The cause is placement, not lifecycle. Step 2 anchors to the Overview graph,
 * which is `h-svh` — a full-viewport-height element whose top edge sits at
 * `y = 0`. Asking for `placement: "top"` puts the card at `0 - height - offset`.
 * Neither of react-joyride's positioning middlewares can recover it:
 *
 * - `flip` (top → bottom) compares overflow both ways. Against a full-height
 *   anchor, *bottom* overflows by exactly as much as *top*, so floating-ui's
 *   best-fit tie-break keeps the original side.
 * - `shift` clamps only its main axis, which for a `top`/`bottom` placement is
 *   the **horizontal** one. The broken axis is unclamped.
 *
 * So this asserts the property the tour actually needs — every stop's card lies
 * fully inside the viewport — rather than the mechanism, which leaves the fix
 * free to change without the test rotting. Step 1 (a sidebar anchor) and the
 * later nav-row stops pass on both HEAD and the fix; step 2 is the one that
 * fails before it.
 *
 * Two window sizes because the bug is a function of the anchor's size relative
 * to the viewport: a stop that fits at one height can overflow at another.

 * assertion below reads the card's own "Step N of M" chip and fails if M ever

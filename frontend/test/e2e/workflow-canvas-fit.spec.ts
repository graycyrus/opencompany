 * Issue #1361: a long pipeline must open readable, and at its start.
 *
 * `workflow-canvas-fit.test.ts` pins the arithmetic. This pins that the
 * arithmetic reaches the canvas an operator actually looks at — which is the
 * half that took three attempts, because the correction is a CHILD of
 * `<ReactFlow>` and had to be sequenced against the parent's own `fitView`. A
 * unit test could not have caught either failed attempt: both produced the
 * right numbers and the wrong canvas.
 *
 * The measurements this replaces, taken by hand against `feature_pipeline`
 * before the fix — zoom **0.353** at 1440px and **0.28** at 1100px, first node
 * at x = -256 and last at x = 1769, both off screen, with a 14px node title
 * rendering at 5px.
 *
 * Runs against the live host the harness brings up (see `playwright.config.ts`).

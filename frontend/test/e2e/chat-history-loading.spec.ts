/**
 * End-to-end proof for issue #934 — a channel never claims to be empty before
 * the host has said so.
 *
 * Reloading a DM that had history rendered "This is the start of your direct
 * message with …" and no messages, for as long as `chat/history` took to
 * answer. Nothing was lost — switching away and back showed the full thread —
 * but the copy is a positive claim about an empty channel, and an operator has
 * no way to tell a false one from real data loss.
 *
 * # Why this is an e2e spec and not a unit test
 *
 * `historyReady()` — the decision itself — *is* unit-tested, in
 * `test/unit/chat-history-hydration.test.ts`. What cannot be tested there is
 * the thing that actually broke: two independent fetches (`RoomView`'s own desk
 * list, `AppShell`'s hydration pass) racing to paint a pane. That race only
 * exists in a browser with a real host behind it, and the bug lived precisely
 * in the window between them.
 *
 * # Why the host's history is delayed rather than merely slow
 *
 * The defect is a timing window, and a timing window observed by luck is a
 * flaky test in both directions — it passes on a fast loopback host whether or
 * not the fix is present. So the DM's `chat/history` is held open on a latch
 * the test opens by hand: the loading state is asserted while the request is
 * provably still in flight, and the settled state after it provably is not.
 * Every other channel's history is left completely alone, which also proves the
 * hold is per channel and not a pane-wide freeze.
 *
 * Like the rest of `test/e2e` this drives a running host — see
 * `playwright.config.ts`.

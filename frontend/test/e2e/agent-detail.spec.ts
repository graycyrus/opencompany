/**
 * Proof for issue #264: an agent can be opened, read, and edited **from the
 * Console**, against the live host.
 *
 * The issue's complaint is a dead end, so the evidence has to be the walk that
 * used to end nowhere: start on the Team tab, open a card, and read the things
 * that had no console surface at all — the instructions the agent was defined
 * with, its tier, the tools it may actually use, and the desks it sits on. The
 * tool grants had no *read endpoint* either (`GET …/team` sent `tools: null`
 * for every member), so this is also the first time that is checkable from
 * outside the process.
 *
 * Runs against the same live host as `wiring.spec.ts` (`companies/e2e_harness`),
 * whose manifest is what the assertions below are pinned to:
 *
 *   * `[tools] allow = ["composio", "mcp:*", "workspace", "workspace.*"]`
 *   * `ceo` is `tier = "orchestrator"`, asks for `mcp:*`, `composio`,
 *     `workspace.read`, and sits on no desk
 *   * `engineer` sits on the Engineering desk
 *
 * Default features are enough: the routes this exercises ship in the default
 * build, so nothing here is behind `capabilities.ts`.
 *
 * The spec removes the teammate it creates, so it can run repeatedly against a
 * host whose data directory persists between runs.

/**
 * A fresh host greets the first visit with a welcome tour rendered over the
 * console, which swallows clicks on the view beneath it.
 *
 * Two halves, and the first is what matters. The tour is suppressed **before
 * the app boots** by seeding its own localStorage markers through an init
 * script, so it never renders and there is nothing to wait for. This is the
 * pattern `board-columns.spec.ts` uses, and it is here for a measured reason:
 * the earlier version of this helper blocked on `waitFor({ timeout: 15_000 })`
 * and swallowed the timeout, which costs the FULL fifteen seconds every time
 * the tour is absent — the common case. This spec navigates three times (the
 * `beforeEach`, the storage-cleared reload, and the cleanup), so it paid that
 * toll three times and blew the 60s test budget without a single assertion
 * failing.
 *
 * The click half stays as a belt-and-braces fallback for a host whose marker
 * key this list does not name, but it polls briefly rather than blocking.

/**
 * Which Add-teammate dialog this host renders (issue #1989).
 *
 * The dialog has two shapes: a name and one box on a company whose copilot can
 * draft, and the original six-field form on one whose cannot. Both ship, and
 * this spec runs against both hosts — the default-feature lane compiles no
 * harness at all, and the live-brain lane has a model behind it — so it has to
 * ask rather than assume.
 *
 * Asked of the **host**, over the same route the dialog itself reads, rather
 * than sniffed off the DOM. Sniffing cannot work here: `cognition` is `null`
 * until `/inference` answers, and `null` renders the reduced dialog, so a probe
 * that looked at the dialog a moment after opening it would report "reduced" on
 * an `echo` host and then watch the form replace it. Asking the host is also
 * the stronger claim — it makes the branch an assertion about a company rather
 * than a description of whatever appeared.
 *
 * The rule is `addTeammateSurface`'s, restated deliberately: a spec that asked
 * the component which surface it had chosen would agree with itself no matter
 * what either of them did.
 *
 * A restatement has to be kept **complete**, which is the cost of the choice
 * above and one this helper has already paid once. It read `cognition` alone,
 * because that was the whole rule when it was written; the rule then grew a
 * second input — `designsProfiles`, the host's own answer about whether a
 * design pass can run — and a `hosted` or `sidecar` company reports a non-`echo`
 * cognition with no drafter behind it. Production renders the full form there
 * and this said `describe`, so the spec would have waited for a box that was
 * never going to appear. Both inputs, in the same order the component takes
 * them.

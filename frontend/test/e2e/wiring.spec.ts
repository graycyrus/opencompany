 * End-to-end wiring proof for the operator console.
 *
 * This single spec exercises the whole chain the console depends on:
 *
 *   magic-link auth → session cookie → console → POST /api/v1/company/chat
 *     → (mocked) LLM backend → reply rendered as a company bubble
 *
 * It runs against a feature-gated host with a mocked inference backend behind
 * it — `mock-brain.mjs`, which `playwright.config.ts` starts and points the
 * host at when `PW_LIVE_BRAIN=1` (issue #467). The spec only asserts on that
 * backend's `__MOCK_LLM__` marker (never exact echo text): the agent harness
 * transforms the prompt before it reaches the backend, so only the marker is
 * stable.
 *
 * The admin address must match `companies/e2e_harness/company.toml`'s
 * `[users] admins`, which is what makes the login flow succeed.

// CSS-based), which is why this spec appeared to reach the composer and then
// timed out on the very next line. Nineteen of the other specs already do this;
// this one predates the tour and was never updated.

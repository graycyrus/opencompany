// A stand-in for the platform's Composio routes, so the end-to-end suite can
// exercise a company that holds **two accounts for one toolkit** (issue #820).
//
// # Why a fixture and not the real backend
//
// The thing under test is which account an agent acts as, and the only way to
// have that question exist is to hold two connections for one toolkit. Against
// the real backend that would mean running two live Gmail OAuth handshakes per
// run, from CI, against an account nobody owns. It would also make the
// assertion unobservable: the point is the **request body** the host sends —
// whether it carries `connectionId` — and only the party receiving it can say.
//
// So this serves the four routes the console and the harness actually call, and
// records every execute body for the spec to read back:
//
//   GET  /agent-integrations/composio/toolkits      → catalog (gmail, slack)
//   GET  /agent-integrations/composio/connections   → two gmail accounts, one slack
//   POST /agent-integrations/composio/authorize     → a connect URL nobody opens
//   POST /agent-integrations/composio/execute       → records the body, succeeds
//   DELETE /agent-integrations/composio/connections/{id}
//
// Plus two routes of its own, outside the backend's namespace so they cannot be
// mistaken for it:
//
//   GET  /healthz     → readiness, for `playwright.config.ts`'s webServer wait
//   GET  /__executes  → every execute body seen, oldest first
//   POST /__delay     → how long the catalog route takes to answer
//   POST /__catalog   → which toolkits this backend publishes
//   POST /__reset     → forget them, and restore the seed connections, catalog and delay
//
// # What it deliberately does not do
//
// It does not check the bearer. Tenant isolation is decided by which credential
// the host presents, and that is asserted where it is decidable — the host's own
// `isolation_tests` in `src/harness/composio.rs` drive a recording backend for
// exactly that. A fixture that also enforced auth would fail runs for reasons
// that have nothing to do with the spec driving it.
//
// No dependencies, so it starts as fast as the other fixtures.

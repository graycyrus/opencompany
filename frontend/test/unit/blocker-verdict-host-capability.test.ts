/**
 * **P1 review finding (Codex) on PR #2038.** This client explicitly supports
 * hosts older than a given field, and `blocker_verdict` is no exception: a host
 * predating it ignores the unknown key and resolves from the lowered two-way
 * `verdict` alone.
 *
 * Two of the four survive that lowering and two do not. `retry` rides an
 * `approve` and `cancel` rides a `deny`, and an unaware host retries and
 * cancels exactly as asked. `skip` also rides an `approve`, so an unaware host
 * **re-runs the step it was asked to leave out**; `amend` rides one too, so it
 * re-runs the step **without the operator's words**. In both cases the console
 * reported the four-way result it thought it had requested while the host
 * performed a different action — the silent divergence this asserts against.
 *
 * The host now says which it is at `/spec` (`blocker-verdict`), so the fix is
 * to check before sending rather than to send and hope. An absent
 * `capabilities` array is an older host still and must read as "assume REST
 * only", never as "supports nothing in particular".

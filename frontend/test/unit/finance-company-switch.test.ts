/**
 * A provider's credentials must not survive a company switch.
 *
 * This suite is normally for pure functions. The exception is earned the same
 * way it was when this file tested `SettingsSection`: the behaviour is not a
 * function anybody can call, it is *composition* — a parent giving a
 * credential-holding page a `key` that changes with the company. A unit test of
 * either alone would pass with the key removed, which is exactly the regression
 * that happened once: clearing fields by hand covered the ones somebody
 * remembered and left the API key, webhook secret and both PayPal halves
 * behind, so an operator who typed a key, switched company, and pressed Save
 * wrote that credential into the wrong company's secret store.
 *
 * The forms moved from Settings → Billing to Finance → Invoicing / Wallet
 * (docs/spec/runtime/finance-console.md), and `FinanceSection` carries the same
 * `key={company ?? "self"}`. What is driven here is the page itself, keyed the
 * way the section keys it — `FinanceSection` lazily imports the Recharts-backed
 * Overview, which this runner has no reason to stand up.

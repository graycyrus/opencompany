/**
 * Issue #1361: a long pipeline must not open below the zoom at which its node
 * titles are still words, and once it is held at that floor it must open at its
 * START rather than its middle.
 *
 * The measurements these tests encode, taken in a real browser against
 * `feature_pipeline` (ten nodes, one per depth layer — the shape every shipped
 * company template has) before the fix:
 *
 *   1440px window → canvas pane 1224x782 → `fitView` zoom **0.353**
 *   1100px window → canvas pane  884x702 → `fitView` zoom **0.28**
 *
 * A node title is `text-sm` (14px), so 0.353 renders it at 4.9px. The console's
 * own type scale bottoms out at 10px (`text-3xs`), which is what fixes the
 * floor at 0.75 — see `LEGIBLE_FIT_ZOOM`.
 *
 * The arithmetic is tested rather than the canvas because it is arithmetic:
 * `FitGraphToPane` is thirty lines of wiring around these two functions, and a
 * jsdom canvas has no layout to measure.

 * taken it to 1198x756. That drift is the argument FOR a constant floor rather
 * than a computed one: `LEGIBLE_FIT_ZOOM` is derived from the type scale, not
 * from the pane, so every assertion below holds at both sizes and at any other
 * the shell arrives at. If one of these ever fails because the pane changed,

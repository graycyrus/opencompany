/**
 * The card half of the two-layer shell (issue #1178).
 *
 * Every page renders on this one card — there is no full-bleed escape hatch,
 * and the component's own docblock says why.
 *
 * These cases pin the contract: which classes the card carries, and that it
 * keeps the scroll container every view's `overflow-y-auto` depends on. They
 * cannot tell 12px from 1px; that is a fact about pixels, and
 * `test/e2e/shell-two-layer.spec.ts` measures it in a real browser. What they
 * catch is the frame, the radius or the edge quietly going missing, and
 * `min-h-0` being dropped — which moves every view's scroll to the window.

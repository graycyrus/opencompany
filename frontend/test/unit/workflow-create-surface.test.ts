/**
 * Which of the two New-workflow dialogs renders.
 *
 * This is the branch the redesign lives or dies on, and its failure is silent
 * in one direction: answer `form` on a create and the dialog looks exactly as
 * it did before, so nothing reports that the one-box dialog never shipped. A
 * rendered test can only prove the cases somebody thought to render; the
 * decision is a pure function so every input can be.
 *
 * There are only two inputs left, and that IS the change. The copilot's
 * availability used to be a third — an `echo` company and a build that answered
 * a capability gap both got the manual graph form. Running it settled it: a
 * host with no model showed the operator the full form, in the one case where
 * hand-authoring a graph is least likely to be what they wanted. What the
 * copilot can do now changes what Create *does*, never what the dialog *is*,
 * and that is asserted where it is visible — against the rendered dialog in
 * `workflow-one-box-dialog.test.ts`, with an `echo` company.

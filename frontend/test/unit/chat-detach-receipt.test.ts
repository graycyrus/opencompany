/**
 * Source-wiring coverage for issue #2021 — the live receipt (issue #1934) riding
 * a detached turn past its 202 into the queued/working window, on every send
 * surface, instead of being dropped for a bare open-turn row.
 *
 * The behaviour lives in three large hosts that the repo already declines to
 * mount for this kind of wiring assertion (`chat-receipt-scope-reset.test.ts`
 * settles `AppShell` the same way): `AppShell`'s send-outcome callbacks and poll
 * settle, `MessageTimeline`'s render gate, and `Transcript`'s working row. The
 * *semantics* of what the receipt shows in each state are proven directly by
 * `chat-live-receipt.test.ts` (`ChatLiveReceipt` + `receiptStateLine`); what
 * this file locks down is that each host is actually wired into them.

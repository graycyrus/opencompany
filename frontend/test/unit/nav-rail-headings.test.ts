/**
 * A navigation rail labels itself; it does not put headings in the page outline.
 *
 * The Settings and Finance rails each captioned themselves with an `<h2>` and,
 * in Settings' case, an `<h3>` per link group. Both rails render *before* the
 * sub-page they navigate, so on `#/settings/connections` or `#/finances` a
 * screen reader walking the outline met a section-level heading before the
 * page's own `h1` — a malformed order that counting `h1`s cannot detect, since
 * the count is right and only the position is wrong (issue #1392).
 *
 * Nothing was lost by demoting them. Each `<nav>` already carries an
 * `aria-label`, which is what names it for assistive technology, and the
 * Settings groups are named by `aria-labelledby` — that resolves against any
 * element, so a `div` names the group exactly as the `h3` did. The captions stay
 * visible; they simply stop being part of the document outline they sit ahead
 * of.
 *
 * A source guard rather than a render test, in the idiom of
 * `dialog-width-override`: the failure is invisible below the level of the whole
 * page. Each rail is unimpeachable read on its own — an `h2` captioning a rail
 * is only wrong once you know an `h1` renders after it.

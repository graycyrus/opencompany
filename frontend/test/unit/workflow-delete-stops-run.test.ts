/**
 * B-121: deleting a workflow with a run in flight stops that run, and the
 * confirmation and the toast both have to say so — this is the tinysweeper
 * "untested-behavior" gap for PR #2053: the backend's `stop_runs_of_workflow`
 * was tested, but none of the three presentation changes this PR made were —
 * the confirmation dialog's wording varies on whether a run is watching, the
 * success toast varies on the same thing, and the view drops `activeRunId`
 * so the Stop control does not survive the workflow it belonged to.
 *
 * Mounting the view (rather than testing a pure helper) is required here for
 * the same reason `workflow-run-failure.test.ts` and `workflow-index-first.test.ts`
 * mount it: what is under test is what ends up on screen, not a return value.

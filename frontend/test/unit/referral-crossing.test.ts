 * **What a crossing looks like to the operator reading it.**
 *
 * The rows a crossing is made of are dropped from the asking desk — an agent
 * who does not work there did not speak there — so this component and the chip
 * beside it are the only account of what was actually asked and answered. The
 * asker's own report is a paraphrase, and paraphrases drift.

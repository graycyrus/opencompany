/**
 * The desktop update banner is silent until it has something to ask.
 *
 * This is the whole UX contract of the feature and it is worth pinning here
 * rather than in a browser walk: the states that must show nothing outnumber
 * the ones that show something, and "nothing rendered" is exactly the assertion
 * a render test is worst at making — an empty screen looks the same whether the
 * rule held or the component failed to mount.
 *
 * The rule: checking for an update, finding one, and downloading it are all
 * work the application does without asking. A banner announcing any of them is
 * a banner about something nobody can act on, and the cost is not neutral — it
 * is what teaches people to dismiss the one that matters.

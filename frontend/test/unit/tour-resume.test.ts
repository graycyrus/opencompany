/**
 * The onboarding tour's resume marker (issue #300), and the coupling that
 * actually matters about it.
 *
 * A marker records a stop by its **view**, and the controller later finds the
 * stop again with `TOUR.findIndex((s) => s.view === resumed)`. Those are two
 * halves of one contract held together by a bare string, and when they drift
 * the failure is silent by construction: `findIndex` answers `-1`, the
 * controller's own comment says a retired stop must be dropped, so it drops it
 * and shows nothing. An operator returning from an OAuth redirect simply does
 * not get their tour back, and no error is raised anywhere.
 *
 * That drift has already happened once. Connections became a page of the
 * Settings section — the stop is `{ view: "settings", sub: "connections" }` —
 * and `oauth-onboarding-resume.spec.ts` went on seeding the retired
 * `"connections"`, so the Playwright spec was red for a reason that had nothing
 * to do with the product. Because nothing ran that suite, the red went
 * unreported and was later filed as a product bug (#428) that does not exist.
 *
 * So the assertion that earns its place here is not "a marker round-trips". It
 * is "**every** view a stop can publish is a view the lookup can find" — the
 * mechanism is *reached*, not merely functional.

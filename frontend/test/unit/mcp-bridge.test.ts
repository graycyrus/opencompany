 * feature adds a server, stores a token, watches it probe healthy — and no agent
 * ever receives a tool from it. What makes this worth a test rather than an
 * inline ternary is the third state: `mcpInBuild` is optional on the wire, and
 * treating a host that never sends it as "the bridge is missing" would replace
 * one false claim with another, on every older host.

 * validation that serves them — including "Give the workflow an id.", which
 * used to fire on a dialog the operator had not finished reading.
 *
 * **On every company and every build.** The copilot's availability used to pick
 * between two dialogs; a host with no model configured got the full graph form,
 * which is the dialog this redesign exists to retire. Now it changes only what
 * Create *does* — draft, or fall back to the operator's own sentence — and what
 * the box says above itself. The `echo` cases below are the ones that prove it,
 * and they are the reason this file renders the component rather than trusting
 * `createSurface` (unit-tested next door): the branch has to reach the DOM.
 *
 * The manual form is unchanged and still reachable, by the one route that
 * needs it — a create the host refused, which names an id there is otherwise no
 * control to obey.

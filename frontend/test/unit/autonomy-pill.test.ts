/**
 * The autonomy pill in the window's title row.
 *
 * What is actually load-bearing here is not that it draws a pill — it is that
 * every word in it came from the host, that it says *nothing* when it does not
 * know, and that it never claims anything about spending. The last one is not
 * fussiness: this build runs its approval gate with policy HITL disabled
 * (`src/runtime/builder.rs:2476`), so `autoApproveUnderUsd` governs nothing and
 * a pill that rendered it would be stating a number that does not apply.
 *
 * Since the pill became a tier *switcher*, one more property joins them and
 * outranks all of them: **the tier on screen is only ever a value the host
 * returned.** A write that fails must leave the previous tier standing. A pill
 * that says `readonly` while the company is on `full` is worse than no pill.

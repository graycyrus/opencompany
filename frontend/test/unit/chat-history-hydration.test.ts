/**
 * The question issue #934 was filed over: may the timeline say this channel is
 * empty?
 *
 * The bug was not a rendering mistake — it was that nothing could answer this.
 * `Transcripts` maps a channel to `ChatMessage[]`, and `transcripts[id] ?? []`
 * turns "nobody has asked the host yet" into "the host says there is nothing",
 * so a reloaded DM with months of history rendered the copy that only belongs
 * on a channel that has never been used.
 *
 * These cases are the whole contract. Each is a state the console genuinely
 * reaches, and getting any of them wrong costs the operator something specific:
 * a false claim of emptiness (which reads as data loss) or a spinner that never
 * resolves (which reads as a hang).

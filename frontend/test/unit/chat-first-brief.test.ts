 *
 * A staffed but empty company used to lead with roster administration. These
 * checks exercise the two ends of the invitation: the card asks the parent to
 * start a brief, and the composer honours that request by replacing and
 * focusing its draft. Keeping them as rendered controls catches a regression
 * where the copy survives but the affordance no longer does anything.

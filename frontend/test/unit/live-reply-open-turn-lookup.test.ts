/**
 * Why a settled turn's cleanup must be addressed by the **state key** and not
 * by the desk, even though the same call needs the desk to reach the host.
 *
 * `hasOtherOpenTurns` is the guard on a thread-wide clear: it answers "is there
 * still work here?", and the caller erases that thread's live rows when it says
 * no. Since #2042 the map it reads is keyed per thread (`engineering#41`), and
 * `ChatView` hands `onSendStart` that same key — so `liveStepsByThread` and
 * `receiptByThread` are keyed by it too.
 *
 * Look the **desk** up in that map and the guard answers about a different
 * conversation: a busy channel makes it say "yes, work remains" for a thread
 * that has none, so the settled thread's rows and receipt are never cleared and
 * accumulate for the life of the session.
 *
 * It does NOT erase a running turn's rows, and it is worth being exact about
 * why, because the opposite is the easy assumption. The desk-addressed version
 * reads the guard and writes the clear under the *same* key, so it only ever
 * clears rows belonging to turns it also checked — it is self-consistent, and
 * fails by omission rather than by over-clearing. What it drops on the floor is
 * every entry filed under a composite key.
 *
 * The desk is still what `chat/history` is addressed by, which is why the two
 * identities are passed separately rather than one being derived and used for
 * everything (Codex review on #2044).

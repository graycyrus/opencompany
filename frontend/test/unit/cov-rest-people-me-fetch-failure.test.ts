/**
 * FINDING, not a passing pin: `PeopleView`'s own `isAdmin` gate
 * (`me?.role === "admin"`) fails closed the same way whether `/auth/me`
 * answered "member" or never answered at all — both leave `me` null-ish and
 * land on the `!isAdmin` branch. That branch is safe (no control is
 * offered either way) but it is not honest: a genuine read failure — a
 * dropped connection, a 500 — renders the identical "Only an admin can
 * manage people" notice a real member would see, rather than the page's own
 * `error` alert a few lines below it, which this failure mode can never
 * reach because the `!isAdmin` return fires first. Skipped because fixing it
 * is a `frontend/src` change, out of scope here; the safe half (no control
 * leaks) already holds and is asserted below.

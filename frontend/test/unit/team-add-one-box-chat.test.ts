// The OTHER Add-teammate dialog — `views/chat/AddMemberDialog`, reached from
// chat's member pane, chat's empty state and the org chart's desk cards (issue
// #1989).
//
// # Why this file exists beside `team-add-one-box.test.ts`
//
// That file mounts `TeamView`, which has a dialog of its own. Three of the four
// entry points to Add teammate use this one instead, and it had no component
// test at all — so every claim about "the reduced dialog" was proved on the
// surface a minority of operators actually meet. The two dialogs share
// `addTeammateSurface`, `describedTeammateFields` and `DescribeTeammate`, and
// nothing else: the branch, the reset and the footer are duplicated in both, and
// duplicated code is exactly what drifts.
//
// The Cancel test below is the case in point. The bug it pins was present in
// both dialogs, in the same shape, and fixing one would have left the other.

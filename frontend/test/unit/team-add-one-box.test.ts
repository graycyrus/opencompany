// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// The reduced Add-teammate dialog, and the redirect that completes it
// (issue #1989).
//
// # Why this is a component test as well as a pure one
//
// `team-add-surface.test.ts` proves the branch decision for every input. What
// it cannot prove is that the component actually *asks* — a dialog that
// hard-rendered the full form would pass every one of those cases. That is
// exactly the silent failure this redesign is exposed to: the full form looks
// precisely like the dialog did before the change, so nothing reports it.
//
// The redirect needs a component test for a second reason. The reduced dialog
// collects a name and a sentence and nothing else, so the description, the
// persona, the budget and the inbox are all still to be written — on the page
// this redirect opens, beside the copilot that drafts two of them. A create
// that lands nowhere is not a smaller dialog, it is a teammate abandoned
// half-written.

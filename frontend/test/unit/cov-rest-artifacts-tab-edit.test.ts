/**
 * The Artifacts tab's append route (`POST …/artifacts/{id}/versions`) is
 * `ScopedCompany` (`ops/artifacts.rs:211`), not `AdminScopedCompany` — any
 * member who can open the card may record an operator edit, and the tab
 * offers "Edit as operator" with no role check of its own, which matches.
 *
 * The property this file actually pins is what makes two tabs appending
 * concurrently safe with no version token on the wire at all: a save sends
 * only `{ body }`, and the tab replaces its whole local copy with whatever
 * the host answers rather than bumping a version count itself — so a second
 * tab's append is reflected exactly, never guessed at or clobbered by a
 * stale in-memory copy.

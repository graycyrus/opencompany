 * Issue #561: the confirmation an operator reads after approving.
 *
 * Approving does not resume a suspended call — the host re-dispatches the teammate,
 * and since #469 it does that once per turn, when the LAST decision that turn
 * parked lands. The console used to say "the teammate is completing the action"
 * for every click, including the three out of four that release nothing. What
 * these pin is that the sentence follows the host's count.

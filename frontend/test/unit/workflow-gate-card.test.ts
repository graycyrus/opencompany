/**
 * Issue #846, the two console-side halves.
 *
 * **The card** said "Continue a paused workflow" and showed the engine's resume
 * payload — a label true of every one of these cards, over a description that
 * describes nothing. #372 made exactly this complaint about the chat surface and
 * #375 fixed it there; this is the same treatment for the workflow-originated
 * card, now that the host names the call on it.
 *
 * **The run** said "Finished — this run routed no reports" while its gate sat
 * undecided on the Approvals page. A run waiting on a person is not finished,
 * and a scheduled run that reports success while doing none of its work is the
 * failure that makes it matter.

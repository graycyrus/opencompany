/**
 * The 768–1023px two-rail band (issue #1383).
 *
 * The app sidebar comes on at `md` (≥768). Chat's channel rail and Settings'
 * sub-rail used to come on *earlier or at the same* breakpoint, so from
 * 768–1023px the window carried two rails plus content and the working pane
 * collapsed to ~290px. In Chat that stranded the composer's Send button off
 * the right edge with no scroll to reach it; in Settings it clipped the SMTP
 * card on both sides. The fix pushes both second rails to `lg` (≥1024) — so
 * 768–1023 is single-rail — and lets the composer's action row wrap so Send
 * can never leave the flow.
 *
 * A jsdom render cannot prove this: the whole failure is a media query, and
 * jsdom does not evaluate them. So this guards the *class contract* the fix
 * rests on — the same source-contract idiom as `shell-chrome-tokens.test.ts`.
 * The pixel-accurate proof (Send clickable, SMTP legible across 768–1024px)
 * is a manual/e2e concern noted in the PR.

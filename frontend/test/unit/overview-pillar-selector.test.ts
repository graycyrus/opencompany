/**
 * Issue #1309: the desk selector would not say which desk was which.
 *
 * It drew one 10px dot per desk at 50% opacity under the words "Pick a
 * desk", and each desk's name existed only in that dot's `title` — a hover
 * away on a pointer and unreachable on touch. So the control whose whole
 * purpose is choosing a desk named none of them at rest, while the graph
 * labelled all of them in their own colours a few inches away. You had to
 * click a blind dot to learn what it was.
 *
 * The caption is also under test, because "Pick a desk / 0 DESKS" was an
 * imperative the page made impossible to follow on a company that has not
 * seated a desk yet.

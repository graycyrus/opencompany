 * renders it — a folder always contains something that could not be read, so
 * the per-item detail is what tells an operator WHICH files landed and which
 * did not. Nothing had pinned that the report actually renders each item's
 * real status and message, as opposed to a blanket "done" the moment any part
 * of a mixed batch stored successfully.

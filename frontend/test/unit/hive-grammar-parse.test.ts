/**
 * The marker grammar.
 *
 * Every case here is a way the console could invent a move the room never made,
 * or drop one it did. Both are silent: a fabricated `!propose` puts an option on
 * a floor nobody offered, and a dropped `!support` makes a carried topic look
 * unbacked. Neither throws, and neither is visible without reading the
 * transcript against the render.
 *
 * Mirrors `src/hivemind/moves.rs` and tinyhivemind's `trace::resolve`.

/**
 * A teammate's run history (issue #1573).
 *
 * A unit render, earned for the reason the instructions-editor render is: the
 * claims under test are what reaches the operator's eye and no pure helper can
 * hold them. Three of them, and each is a way of being wrong that looks
 * completely normal on screen.
 *
 * 1. **The desk selector actually goes to the host.** An unrecognised query
 *    parameter is *ignored*, not refused, so a host predating `?agent=` answers
 *    with the whole company's newest attempts. Every row would be real and the
 *    page would still be a lie.
 * 2. **…and the answer is filtered anyway.** Which is what makes that host
 *    under-report rather than misattribute.
 * 3. **A failed source read does not cost the history.** The board and the
 *    workflow list are what turn a `taskId` into a title; when they fail, every
 *    attempt must still list.

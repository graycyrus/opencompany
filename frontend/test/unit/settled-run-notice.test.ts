/**
 * B-039: what the console says the moment a run an operator started settles.
 *
 * It used to say one thing — `toast.success("Workflow ran.")` — for every run
 * whose body came back, which is every run that did not throw. A run the
 * operator had just pressed **Stop** on got it too, so one screen reported a
 * single run three contradictory ways at once: "stopped" on the row, "Workflow
 * ran." in the toast, and an output-shape error in the drawer.
 *
 * The reading now comes from the host's `verdict` (issue #981), the same word
 * every other reader of a run's outcome already mirrors.

/**
 * Collapsing a room's turns into one timeline item.
 *
 * The additive-parameter shape is the point: `buildTimelineItems` grew a fourth
 * argument, so every call site and every spec written before deliberation keeps
 * its exact behaviour. The first test here is the one that matters — with no
 * episodes the function must return precisely what it always did, because that
 * is what lets ~36 existing model specs go on being the regression net for this
 * whole change rather than casualties of it.

/**
 * Expanding the compact rail keeps keyboard focus on a collapse control
 * (issue #1340 focus review).
 *
 * The compact rail's expand button only exists in the collapsed branch, so
 * expanding it unmounts the very control that carried focus and a keyboard user
 * falls out to the document. The expand action therefore hands focus to a
 * control that is mounted in both states.
 *
 * Which control that is changed with the four-row sidebar. It was a toggle in
 * the chat header; the rail is a section of the app sidebar now, so that toggle
 * became a duplicate of `SidebarCollapseButton` sitting forty pixels from it,
 * and was removed. The seam button is what survives the switch, and it is what
 * catches the focus.
 *
 * A jsdom render of `ChatView` cannot prove this — it needs the whole client
 * and every hook. So this guards the *wiring contract* the fix rests on, the
 * same source-contract idiom as `responsive-two-rail-band.test.ts`: the rail
 * fires `onExpand`, and the view hands focus to the one collapse control that
 * is mounted on both sides of the switch.

// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// The connection scope on the hash (issue #1358).
//
// What the reported bug actually was: selecting a host wrote no history entry
// and the hash named a page without naming whose. On the "Can't connect" screen
// of an unreachable host, Back therefore looked completely inert — while
// popping entries belonging to the host still working, so switching back landed
// on Overview rather than the Tasks board it had been rewound from.
//
// The three properties these pin are the three halves of that, and each one
// fails on its own:
//
//   - a switch is a push, so Back undoes it;
//   - the scope survives an ordinary view navigation, so the entries Back
//     returns through keep naming their host;
//   - the address is repaired towards the host on screen, never away from a
//     host the address already names — the second is what would undo a Back.

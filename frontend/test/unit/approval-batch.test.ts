/**
 * One turn asks once (issue #842).
 *
 * A research turn that reached espn.com, bbc.com and theguardian.com parked
 * three approvals and interrupted the conversation three times — three
 * sign-offs, and three re-dispatch cycles (#561) for one piece of work. The
 * host already knew they belonged together: #469 records the parking turn so it
 * can continue that turn exactly once. `batch` carries that key out to the
 * console, and this is where it is turned into one card.
 *
 * What must **not** happen is the reason this suite is worth its length. The
 * grouping is presentation over records that stay individually decidable, and
 * two mistakes would each be invisible in a screenshot:
 *
 *  * folding approvals the host did *not* say belonged together — an operator
 *    approving something they were never shown;
 *  * a card that keeps claiming three things are pending after one was decided
 *    on the Approvals page, which is the two surfaces drifting.

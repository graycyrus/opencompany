 * A real double-click on the board card's Resume button.
 *
 * `task-blocked-card.test.ts` proves Resume is *disabled* whenever the card's
 * own approvals are outstanding — the derived-state half of the rule. It never
 * drives two rapid clicks through the button while the card is clear to
 * resume, which is the other half: nothing in `resumeButton`'s `onClick`
 * depends on anything that changes between the two clicks of a real
 * double-click, so a debounce would have to live in the handler itself.

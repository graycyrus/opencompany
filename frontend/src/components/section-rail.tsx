 * and losing it whenever they step into Company or Connections costs more than
 * the 240px this column charges. The full argument, including the one this
 * reverses, is on `NAV_SECTIONS` in `components/sidebar-navigation.tsx`.
 *
 * ## Modelled on the Settings rail, deliberately
 *
 * Same widths, same breakpoint, same two shapes: a `w-60` rail from `lg`, and a
 * scrolling row of chips below it. `SettingsSection` keeps drawing its own
 * because its rows are `<a href>` links over one view's sub-pages rather than
 * `(view, sub)` navigations, but the geometry is copied from it on purpose so
 * that an operator meets one pattern rather than two that nearly agree.
 *
 * The breakpoint is `lg`, not `sm`, and that is the whole of issue #1383: from
 * 768–1023px the app sidebar is already on, and a second `w-60` rail there
 * squeezes the working pane to ~290px. Below `lg` this collapses to chips so
 * the pane gets the full width.

 * table, read from both ends, so a row added to a section appears here without
 * anyone remembering to add it twice.
 *
 * Room and Flows have no children, so they render their page with no rail at
 * all: Room's sub-navigation is the channel list, which is pinned in the
 * sidebar, and Flows has none to move. Settings is not in this table (it is a
 * footer utility, not one of the four) and keeps drawing its own rail.
 *
 * ## The Finance question
 *
 * Company's rows include Finance, and Finance has three sub-pages of its own —
 * as does Settings, and both used to draw a `w-60` rail inside the page. Under
 * this layout Company already draws one, so Finance's would be the *second*
 * rail in the viewport: sidebar plus 240 plus 240 plus content, which is the
 * 768–1023px band issue #1383 was filed about, now reproduced at every width.
 *
 * So they nest rather than stacking: Finance's pages are indented rows on
 * Company's rail, visible while Finance is the open row. One rail per section,
 * always, and never two. `FinanceSection` is dispatch-only as a result — the
 * shape `ConnectionsSection` has had since PR #1977.

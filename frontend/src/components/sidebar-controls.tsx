 * They use the nav's own row primitive for that reason: one shape, one hover,
 * one active treatment, and the tooltip on the collapsed rail comes free. What

          `TITLE_BAR_LADDER.overview` is `hidden md:inline-flex`: below 768px
          the title row drops Overview first, deliberately, because it is a
          destination you choose while a pending count is one that chooses you
          (#1980). That reasoning was sound while the sidebar still carried an
          Overview row — and this change is what removed it. The intersection of
          the two left phone-sized viewports with no path to the page at all:
          the title-row button is `display: none` and the sheet held only the
          four sections, so an operator had to know to type `#/overview`
          (codex P1 review on #1987). Confirmed in a browser at 390px before
          this: zero controls named Overview anywhere on the page.

          `md:hidden` is the exact complement of the ladder's `hidden
          md:inline-flex`, so the two are one decision rather than two: Overview
          is on screen at every width, in exactly one place, and there is no
          width at which it is in both or in neither. `overview-reachable.test.ts`
          pins that complementarity rather than either class on its own.

          Here rather than as a fifth nav row because the four are a fixed
          block — always four, always contiguous — and a row that appears only
          on a phone would break the thing this restructure exists to establish. */}

/**
 * Show or hide the sidebar. A button on the content card's leading seam.
 *
 * ## Why it is not a row (issue #1177)
 *
 * It used to be a `SidebarMenuButton` — full width, icon then label, `h-8`,
 * `bg-sidebar-accent` on hover — sitting directly under the host switcher and
 * directly above Overview. That is the nav row shape exactly, so the eye filed
 * it as the first destination in the list. It is not a destination: everything
 * else in that column takes you somewhere, and this one changes the chrome and
 * leaves you where you are.
 *
 * Colouring it differently would not have fixed that; the shape is what says
 * "row". So it stops using the row primitive altogether and becomes the
 * console's ordinary icon button.
 *
 * ## Why it is not in the sidebar at all
 *
 * Its next home was the sidebar's own header, beside the host switcher. That
 * put the control that *hides* a panel inside the panel it hides: collapsing
 * the column took the button with it, and the rail had to keep a version of it
 * standing in 32px of content box.
 *
 * Both of those are gone now. The switcher moved to the window's title row
 * (`window-title-bar.tsx`) and the header went with it, so this button is
 * rendered from `app-shell.tsx` inside `SidebarInset`, absolutely positioned on
 * the leading border of the content card — `left-(--frame-inset)` puts it at
 * the edge and `-translate-x-1/2` straddles it. It is one control in both
 * states, it points at the edge that moves, and it costs the page no layout.
 * `sidebar-toggle-reachable.spec.ts` pins that placement.
 *
 * It carries its own fill at rest for the same reason: alone on a border, with
 * no neighbours to belong to and no surface behind it, a ghost glyph read as
 * something drawn on the seam rather than as something pressable. See the
 * class list below.

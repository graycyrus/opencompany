// The standing autonomy policy, stated in the window's title row — and, since
// the operator asked for it, changed from there too.
//
// This is a claim about what the agents are allowed to do without asking, so
// every word of it is read from the host rather than written here. Three
// findings shaped what it does and does not say, and they still govern what the
// menu is allowed to put in front of an operator:
//
// **The tier is one of four, not two.** `POLICY_MODES` in
// `src/company/types.rs:96` is `["readonly", "supervised", "auto", "full"]`.
// Flattening that to "Auto / not Auto" would report `readonly` — agents that
// change nothing, contact nobody and use no connected account — and `full` — the
// runtime has — as the same thing. The menu therefore lists whatever
// `status.tiers` holds and never a list of four written here.
//
// **The label and the sentence are the host's**, taken from the `tiers` list
// `GET {scope}/policy` returns. That list is filtered server-side to the modes
// *this* runtime accepts (`selectable_tiers`, `src/server/ops/policy.rs:153`),
// and its prose lives in `TIER_TEXT` (`policy.rs:121`) precisely so it cannot
// drift from the gate it describes. A console built against a newer host names
// a tier it has no text for by its mode word rather than dropping it — and,
// now that the menu is a control, *offers* it rather than dropping it, because
// a tier the host will accept that the console will not show is a capability
// silently withheld.
//
// **It deliberately says nothing about spending.** The obvious sentence here —
// "agents stop before spending" — is false in this build, and so is any
// rendering of `autoApproveUnderUsd`. The native gate is constructed
// `.with_policy_hitl_disabled()` (`src/runtime/builder.rs:2476`), and with that
// flag `evaluate` returns `Allow` for everything except `readonly` *before* it
// reaches the tier match or the spend threshold (`src/policy/gate.rs:749-757`);
// the tool path short-circuits the same way at
// `src/harness/built_in/policy.rs:1701`, above `always_approve`, the per-agent
// daily budget and `auto_approve_under_usd`. The console already says this out
// loud on the settings page, where the field is labelled "Spend approval
// threshold (inactive)" and disabled (`policy-settings.tsx:917`). A number that
// governs nothing is exactly the placeholder this row must not carry, so the
// pill carries the tier and the host's own words about it, and stops there.
//
// It renders **nothing** when the policy is unknown. See {@link useAutonomy}.

 * - `supervised` — {@link UserCheck}: a person is in the loop. The distinction
 *   from `auto` is not how much the agents do, it is that somebody signs off,
 *   so the icon carries the person rather than a smaller amount of work.
 * - `auto` — {@link Zap}: it acts on its own. The step from `supervised` is the
 *   human leaving the loop, and a bolt is "this happens by itself".
 * - `full` — {@link InfinityIcon}: no ceiling. It is the *widest* tier, not the
 *   most dangerous one, and infinity says "nothing further to remove" while a
 *   warning triangle or a flame would say something the host does not.
 *

 * The autonomy pill: what the agents may do, and the control that changes it.
 *
 * It used to be a `<span>` with no click target, on the argument that the row
 * it sits in is the window's drag surface and a button here would take presses
 * away from dragging. That was reversed deliberately: the tier is the fact this
 * row exists to carry, and the shortest path from reading it to changing it is
 * the thing an operator reaches for when a company is doing something they want
 * stopped.
 *
 * **The drag band survives it.** `data-tauri-drag-region` is opt-in per element
 * and does not inherit, so the attribute is simply removed from the pill rather
 * than fought with: `WindowTitleBar` already puts a dedicated `flex-1`
 * `self-stretch` spacer carrying its own `data-tauri-drag-region` between the
 * company switcher and this pill, and that spacer — not the pill — is the
 * elastic part of the row. Every other item in the row (the switcher, the
 * profile control) is likewise a control the drag band goes around. Giving the
 * pill its pointer events back costs the window a fixed ~200px of grab area at
 * the right-hand end and none of the elastic middle, which is where a window is
 * actually dragged from.
 *
 * **The displayed tier is only ever a value the host returned.** The write goes
 * through `setPolicy`, which answers with the resulting `PolicyStatus`; that
 * answer is handed to {@link applyAutonomy} so the row updates in one round
 * trip instead of waiting up to 30s for the next poll. Nothing is written
 * optimistically and nothing is written on failure, so a rejected change leaves
 * the previous tier on screen and says why in a toast. A pill that lied about
 * what the agents are allowed to do is the one failure this component cannot
 * have.
 *
 * **Widening the tier is confirmed here exactly as it is on the settings page.**
 * `policy-settings.tsx` has put an `AlertDialog` in front of any move *up* the
 * host's tier order since #1423, and this control reuses that comparison and
 * that wording rather than restating either. Without it the title bar would be
 * a strictly lower-friction route to the broadest autonomy this runtime has
 * than the page that was deliberately given the gate — which is not a
 * difference in style, it is the gate not being there. Narrowing is one click
 * in both places, for the same reason: pulling capability back is what an
 * operator does in a hurry.
 *
 * **It is a control only for the people who can actually use it.** The two
 * write routes behind it — `PUT` and `DELETE {scope}/policy` — both call
 * `require_admin` (`src/server/ops/policy.rs:309,427`), so a member picking a
 * tier here was guaranteed a 403 and a red toast. `read_policy` carries no such
 * guard, and deliberately: the standing policy is a fact about what the agents
 * around you may do, and the people living under it are exactly who should be
 * able to read it. So a member gets the pill, the tier and the host's sentence,
 * and no menu — see the `canManage` prop.
 *
 * `client` and `company` come from {@link useConsole} rather than props: the
 * shell mounts this element inside its own `ConsoleProvider`, and the title row
 * between them (`WindowTitleBar`) is a pure layout component that takes the
 * pill as an opaque `ReactNode` and knows nothing about policy.

          what is different about it.

          it: the menu unmounts its rows the moment one is pressed, so a dialog
          living under a row would be torn down with the row that opened it. */}

/**
 * The console's single content sheet — the "card" half of the two-layer shell
 * (issue #1178).
 *
 * The shell is two layers, not two panes. The window *chrome* (`--chrome`) is
 * painted exactly once, on the shell root, and both the sidebar column and the
 * margin around this card are that one surface showing through: the sidebar
 * paints no fill of its own and the panes carry no divider. Tinting each pane
 * separately would land them on different values and put back the 1px seam the
 * layout exists to remove.
 *
 * This card is the only opaque sheet left. Everything a page draws — its own
 * `bg-card` panels, its dialogs — stacks on top of it, which is why it keeps
 * `--background` rather than taking a colour of its own: page contrast is
 * unchanged from before the shell was rebuilt.
 *
 * # Every page is framed, and there is no escape hatch
 *
 * There was one. `unframed` rendered a page edge-to-edge, and two surfaces took
 * it: the Overview knowledge graph and the React Flow workflow canvas. The
 * reference shell this was ported from keeps that prop for a reason that does
 * not exist here — its provider webviews were composited by CEF *above* the
 * HTML layer, so a rounded card underneath showed four square corners punching
 * through, maskable by no CSS. Nothing in this console draws above the HTML
 * layer, so the constraint is absent, and a mechanism with no consumers is a
 * thing that rots. Both canvases sit on this card like every other page.
 *
 * If a surface ever genuinely cannot be framed, this is where the prop goes
 * back — but it should come back with the surface that needs it, not before.
 */

/**
 * `--frame-inset` on all four sides, so the frame is one quantity rather than
 * four numbers that happen to agree — and so it reads as a deliberate frame
 * rather than the hairline sliver a three-sided inset gives.
 *
 * `min-h-0` is what lets a view's own `overflow-y-auto` actually scroll: a flex
 * item's default `min-height: auto` floors it at its content's height, so
 * without this the surface grows to fit the page and the scroll happens on the
 * window instead — the same failure `SidebarInset`'s `min-w-0` fixes on the
 * other axis (issue #334).
 *
 * The edge is a full-perimeter hairline rather than the offset one the
 * reference shell uses. That shell insets the card to reveal an *animated*
 * backdrop, which does the separating; here the chrome is a static tint, and in
 * dark mode the card (#08090B) and the chrome (#121315) are 1.07:1 apart — fill
 * contrast alone at that range is a gradient, not an edge. `shadow-sm` carries
 * the lift, and it already resolves to the theme's own treatment: a tinted drop
 * shadow in light, a 1px inset top highlight in dark, which is what actually
 * reads as "raised" against near-black.

          This card carried one because the window drew no title bar of its own,
          so the top of the content was the only thing left to grab. There is a
          real full-width title row now (`window-title-bar.tsx`), which drags
          where it is not covered by a control — so this band stopped being the
          handle and stayed only as 28px at the top of every page that quietly
          refused a press. It was the spacing under the new row, and the reason
          the two canvases you can drag lost their top edge. */}

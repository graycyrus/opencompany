/**
 * The seam that lets Room's channel list live in the app sidebar while its
 * data keeps living in `ChatView`.
 *
 * The sidebar and the content pane are siblings under `SidebarProvider`, so the
 * sidebar cannot reach into `ChatView`'s state and `ChatView` cannot render into
 * the sidebar's tree. Two ways out of that: lift the whole rail model — sections,
 * unread, mentions, the roster, the fold set, the two dialogs it opens — up into
 * the shell, or leave it exactly where it is and portal the rendered rail into a
 * slot the sidebar owns.
 *
 * This is the second. `ChatView` stays the one owner of the chat model (it is
 * 2,400 lines of it), the rail keeps rendering from that state on the same
 * render pass, and `NewMessageDialog` and `ChannelCreateDialog` keep opening
 * from inside `ChatView`'s React tree even though their triggers are painted in
 * the sidebar — a portal moves the DOM node, not the component tree, so context,
 * events and focus management all still resolve against Chat.
 *
 * Lifting the state instead would have meant an effect in `ChatView` writing the
 * model up to the shell and a second render of the whole console every time an
 * unread count changed.
 *
 * The slot is `null` whenever the Room section is not expanded — a different
 * section is active, or the mobile sheet is closed and has unmounted its
 * contents. `ChatView` renders no rail at all then, which is the intended
 * behaviour rather than a fallback.
 *
 * The sidebar's own density travels the same way. `ChatView` used to keep a
 * `collapsed` flag of its own in `localStorage` (`lib/chat-rail.ts`), because the
 * rail was its own column and nothing else governed it. It is a section of the
 * app sidebar now, so the sidebar's state IS the rail's state — one control, one
 * persisted preference (the sidebar's cookie), and no way for the two to
 * disagree.

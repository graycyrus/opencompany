/**
 * The console's four sections.
 *
 * ## Why four rows and not ten
 *
 * Ten flat rows is not a list an operator scans, it is a wall — the same
 * judgement `docs/spec/runtime/ledgers-console-ia.md` made when it rejected a
 * row per declared list. What replaces it is four things you can name without
 * reading: the room you talk in, the company you are running, what it is
 * connected to, and the work it repeats. Everything else is filed under one of
 * them, in the sidebar, visible while you are in that section.
 *
 * ## Labels and view ids are allowed to differ
 *
 * "Room" is the `chat` view and "Flows" is `workflows`, exactly as "Work" has
 * been the `ledgers` view since #1284. A view id is an **address** — every
 * `#/chat/<channelId>` link ever minted, every `#/workflows/<id>` a run row
 * points at — and renaming a row is not a reason to break them. The `data-tour`
 * anchors follow the view id for the same reason: they are how the guided tour
 * and the e2e specs find a row, and they should not move when a word does.
 *
 * ## Sub-navigation lives in the CONTENT area, not here
 *
 * This table feeds two surfaces now, and only one of them is the sidebar. The
 * four rows above are the sidebar's; every `children` list below is read by
 * `components/section-rail.tsx` and drawn as the first column of the content
 * area, the way Settings has always drawn its own.
 *
 * ### This reverses what shipped, on purpose (issue #2130)
 *
 * The argument that put these rows in the sidebar was good, and it is written
 * out here rather than deleted, because a decision reversed without its reasons
 * on the page gets reversed back. It said: a rail inside the page puts the same
 * kind of list in two different places depending on which section you are in —
 * the sidebar for the sections without sub-pages, a rail for the ones with — so
 * there is no rule to learn; and it charges the content pane 240px on every page
 * under it, on a screen that already has a sidebar. PR #1977 shipped a
 * Connections content rail and then removed it on exactly that reasoning.
 *
 * What outweighs it is what the sidebar's middle region was being spent on. It
 * held whichever section you were in, which meant it held the **channel list**
 * only while you were in Room — and the channel list is the one list an operator
 * comes back to continuously, from wherever they are. Losing it on every trip to
 * Company, Connections or Flows costs more than 240px of content width does,
 * because it is not a width, it is a round trip: go to Room, find the channel,
 * come back.
 *
 * So the trade is inverted. The sidebar's middle region is the Room rail,
 * permanently, on every section (`SidebarNavigation` below, and `room-rail.tsx`
 * for the portal that fills it). The sections that had sub-navigation there draw
 * it as a content rail instead.
 *
 * The "two places" half of the old argument survives the reversal, and is
 * answered rather than ignored: there is exactly **one** rule now, which is that
 * a section's sub-navigation is the first column of its content, and exactly one
 * rail on screen at a time. Finance and Settings each drew a `w-60` rail of
 * their own; Finance's is gone, folded into Company's as nested rows, precisely
 * so that the rule has no exception (see `SectionContentRail`). Settings keeps
 * drawing its own because it is not one of the four sections at all — it is a
 * footer utility — and its rail *is* this pattern.

  //     the collapsed rail (issue #1018). Discoverable elsewhere, in Rule 6's
  //     first sense.
  //   - Observatory moved DOWN, into Settings (`settings-pages.ts`), as a rail
  //     row. The rewrite runs the other way from the one you would guess:
  //     `#/settings/observatory` is rewritten onto `#/observatory`, NOT the
  //     reverse. The Observatory reads four query keys straight off the hash
  //     and keys them on its head being `observatory` (`views/observatory/
  //     hash.ts`), so under `#/settings/…` its analytics tab and its
  //     agent/turn selection stop being addressable. The rail row is the
  //     doorway; the surface keeps its own top-level address, and
  //     `#/observatory/<runId>` stays deep-linkable from workflow rows,
  //     approval cards and chat.
  //
  // Agent-authored internal dashboard pages, rendered in a sandboxed iframe
  // (docs/spec/runtime/pages.md), are deliberately NOT offered here (issues
  // #1171, #1172). Do not "fix" the omission by adding a row. What keeps
  // `#/pages` answering is its entry in `@/lib/console-routes`, never a row in
  // this table — a commented row routes nothing, which is exactly how the
  // address died for four months (issue #1311).
  //
  // Settings is not here either, and its absence is deliberate in the same
  // way: it is a utility, not a place an operator works, so it sits on the
  // sidebar's footer with Feedback and Discord (`SidebarUtilityBar`), which
  // still carries the `data-tour="nav-settings"` anchor the guided tour

 * a row in place.
 *
 * What is below the four used to swap with the section you were in. It does not
 * any more (issue #2130): it is the channel list, on every section, and every
 * other section's sub-navigation is the first column of its content area
 * instead (`components/section-rail.tsx`). The reversal and what it is worth are
 * argued on `NAV_SECTIONS` above.
 *
 * That makes the column entirely fixed furniture — four rows and one list, in
 * the same place on every route — which is the property the four-row restructure
 * was reaching for and could not have while the middle region was a variable.
 * There is still no open/closed state to keep anywhere.
 *
 * The two blocks are separated by space rather than by a rule: the column is
 * already quiet, and the console draws no rule above its footer either, so one
 * here would have been the only seam in it.
 *
 * The alternative — each row expanding under itself, pushing the rows after it
 * down — was the first thing this looked like and is worse in two specific
 * ways. The rows move, so the muscle memory of "Flows is the fourth thing" only
 * holds while nothing above it is open. And the one region whose contents are
 * unbounded, the channel list, pushes every row after it off the bottom at an
 * ordinary twenty channels — which recreates, inside one row, exactly the wall
 * this restructure exists to remove (`ledgers-console-ia.md` Rule 2, Draft 1).
 *
 * With a fixed block the four rows never scroll away and the rail is the only
 * thing that scrolls.
 *
 * ## On the collapsed rail
 *
 * The four icons stay, and so does the channel list: `ChannelRail` has a compact
 * variant built for exactly this width (avatars and `#` glyphs with unread
 * dots), and dropping it would make collapsing the sidebar silently lose the
 * channel list — the same regression issue #1018 filed about the approvals
 * badge. Nothing else is in this region to hide any more; the fixed lists of
 * child rows that used to be hidden here at 3rem are content-rail rows now.

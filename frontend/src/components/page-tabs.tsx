// The console's one page-level sub-tab strip, and the panel that answers it.
//
// # What this is for
//
// Some pages are one subject seen several ways rather than several pages. MCP
// is the case that prompted this: its rows and its `mcp.json` are the *same*
// configuration read through the same host routes, so splitting them into two
// sidebar destinations would put one source of truth behind two addresses —
// which is what issue #414 was. A tab keeps them one page while letting each
// have an address.
//
// The test for reaching for this rather than a sub-page: would a sidebar row
// for each be a lie about how many things the page is? Brain's Overview,
// Upload and Settings are three jobs that change at three different rates and
// each earned a row. MCP's two are one job in two notations.
//
// # Why the strip lives in the header
//
// The tabs sit at the bottom of `PageHeader`'s bar, flush with its hairline, so
// the active tab's underline lands *on* the rule that separates the page's name
// from the page. That is what makes them read as slices of this page rather
// than as a control the page happens to draw first — the shape OpenHuman's
// Connections page uses, and GitHub's and Linear's, for the same reason.
//
// They were in the body on MCP, under a permissions alert, which put a
// page-level navigation control below page-level content and left the header
// naming a page whose two halves it said nothing about.
//
// # Why not `components/ui/tabs.tsx`
//
// Base UI's `Tabs` needs its list and its panels inside one root. The strip
// renders into the header and the panels into the body — different subtrees,
// with the page's scroll container in between — so a single root would have to
// wrap the whole page and thread `value` back down anyway. This keeps the ARIA
// wiring (`role`, `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`) and drops the constraint.
//
// The state lives in the URL via `useHashTab`, so a tab is linkable and answers
// the Back button. The strip itself is controlled and knows nothing about that.

// The desktop window's own chrome: what replaces the native title bar once the
// window stops drawing one.
//
// `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` runs the main window with `titleBarStyle:
// "Overlay"` and `hiddenTitle: true`, which is macOS's transparent title bar:
// the bar itself is gone, the traffic lights float over the web content, and
// the window keeps its rounded corners and its resize edges. Two things stop
// working the moment that happens, and this file is both of them.
//
// **Dragging.** With no title bar there is nothing to grab. macOS does not make
// the top of the content draggable on its own — the webview captures the
// pointer — so a band has to opt back in with `data-tauri-drag-region`. See
// {@link WindowDragBar}.
//
// **The lights' backdrop.** They are drawn over whatever is at the window's
// top-left, which in this console is the sidebar's company switcher. A control
// under three floating circles is a control you cannot click. See
// {@link WindowControlsInset}, which reserves the strip they land in.
//
// Both are macOS-and-desktop only. Windows and Linux keep their native
// decorated title bar (`Overlay` is a no-op there), so reserving a band would
// waste vertical space, and in a browser there is no window to drag at all.
// This mirrors `WindowDragBar.tsx` and `AppSidebar.tsx` in the vendored
// OpenHuman checkout, which solved the same two problems for the same reason.

 *
 * `trafficLightPosition.y` in `tauri.conf.json` is 16 and the buttons are the

 * A row of height H laid out with `align-items: center` centres its contents

 * switcher, the profile control and the lights share one centre line.
 *
 * The two therefore move together: change `trafficLightPosition.y` to Y and
 * this must become `2 * (Y + 6)`, or the lights sit off the row's centre. It is
 * also comfortably taller than the 36px switcher trigger it carries, which

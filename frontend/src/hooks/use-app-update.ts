/**
 * The desktop shell's update flow: probing, downloading, and the restart.
 *
 * All of the logic, so that `AppUpdatePrompt` can be a component with no
 * decisions in it. What the operator is shown is [`isActionable`] in
 * `lib/app-update.ts`; what happens is here.
 *
 * # A download nobody asked for
 *
 * The check runs on a timer and, when it finds something, the download starts
 * on its own. That is deliberate and it is what makes the prompt honest: by the
 * time anybody is asked anything, the bytes are already on disk and verified,
 * so "Restart now" takes seconds rather than opening a progress bar the
 * operator then has to sit through. The cost is bandwidth on a release day,
 * which is the right thing to spend to avoid interrupting somebody twice.
 *
 * # Phases are driven from here, not from an event bus
 *
 * Each phase is set around the `await` that causes it, rather than pushed from
 * Rust over a channel. The core reports progress to nothing because nothing
 * renders progress — the download is silent by design — so a channel would
 * carry bytes no surface displays and give the phase machine two writers. If a
 * future surface wants a progress bar (an "About this app" panel, say), that is
 * when the channel earns its place.
 *
 * # Nothing happens in a browser
 *
 * `isDesktopRuntime()` gates every timer and every call. The web console is
 * whatever the host served on the last page load; it has no bundle to replace,
 * and it must not run a fifteen-minute timer to be told so.

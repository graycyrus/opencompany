// button. `useHashView`'s segment parsing strips everything from `?` onward
// (`readSegments`), so this rides alongside the router without the router ever
// seeing it, exactly as `?new` does.
//
// It is the shape OpenHuman's Connections page already uses (`?tab=<name>`), so
// a link pasted between the two consoles reads the same way.

/**
 * The graph's one non-declared placement, available without a hover-only cue.
 *
 * A native disclosure gives the caveat a visible affordance and lets pointer,
 * keyboard, and touch users keep its canonical explanation open while they
 * read the wheel.
 *
 * The explanation opens ABOVE the summary and stays IN FLOW rather than
 * floating as an absolute popover. Both facts are forced by where this lives:
 * its only caller is the compact legend, which the fullscreen field pins at
 * `bottom-5 left-5` inside an `overflow-hidden` container.
 *
 * - Opening downward put the panel in the ~20px strip below the legend, where
 *   it was clipped away — the caveat stayed unreadable for exactly the
 *   pointer, keyboard, and touch users this component exists to serve.
 * - An absolute panel then had the same problem sideways: anchored to one
 *   edge of a summary whose position moves with the legend's wrapping, it ran
 *   off whichever side it was not anchored to at narrow widths.
 *
 * In flow, the panel simply grows the legend box upward into the field, which
 * is the one direction that always has room. `flex-col-reverse` renders it
 * above the summary while leaving the summary first in the DOM, so the native
 * disclosure semantics and focus order are untouched.

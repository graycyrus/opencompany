/**
 * Raise an invoice against a real customer.
 *
 * The only destructive thing in the Finance section, and there is no route that
 * undoes it. Three things this dialog has to get right:
 *
 * # Minor units
 *
 * The form takes dollars-and-cents and converts with `toMinorUnits`, which is
 * string arithmetic — never `amount * 100`, which drifts. The minor-unit value
 * that will actually be sent is rendered under the field, because the host's
 * `*_in_minor_units` naming exists precisely so "invoice Alan $100" cannot
 * become a $1.00 invoice, and a UI that hid the unit would re-open that hole
 * from the other side.
 *
 * # Idempotency
 *
 * The key is derived from the invoice's own content — see
 * `deriveInvoiceIdempotencyKey` — not from when the dialog opened. A
 * double-clicked Send is one invoice, and so is a failed send followed by a
 * close-reopen-resend of the *same* invoice, because the fields that identify
 * it hash the same either way. Chargebee replays the original for a repeated
 * key and the reply is byte-identical to a fresh one, so
 * `replayed_earlier_invoice` is the only way to tell — and the toast says
 * "already sent" rather than "sent" when it is set. `invoice-force-new`
 * mints a nonce into the hash for the rare deliberate duplicate — once, when
 * the box is checked, not per send, and it survives a retry of that same
 * forced send, close-reopen included, until it succeeds or the operator
 * unchecks the box to start a separate deliberate resend. An
 * attempted-and-unresolved nonce is latched (`forceNewNonceStore`) against
 * the invoice it was minted for, so retyping that same invoice after a
 * reload re-adopts it while a different invoice gets its own. Otherwise a
 * second ambiguous timeout on the forced path would mint a second real
 * invoice — the exact failure this dialog exists to prevent. The box is
 * frozen while a send is in flight, so a mid-flight toggle cannot replace
 * the nonce the pending request already carries.
 *
 * # Naming the money
 *
 * The confirm line states the recipient, the amount in the currency, and the
 * site, flagging a live one. Not "Are you sure?", which asks a question the
 * operator cannot answer without the facts it omits.

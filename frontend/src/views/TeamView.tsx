                  budget-editing items ("Set/Change daily budget…", "Remove
                  cap", "Reset to company default") are gone too, for the same
                  reason the Inbox switch left the card in #1190: a card in a
                  grid of thirteen is for recognising a teammate, not
                  configuring one. Editing now lives on the teammate's own
                  detail page, beside Inbox — see `AgentDetailView`'s `Budget`
                  section. The card still *shows* the cap and today's spend
                  via `DailyBudgetLine` below; only the controls that write
                  moved.

                  That leaves exactly one item. It stays a menu rather than a
                  bare button: Remove is destructive, and a deliberate extra
                  click before it is worth keeping beside the title action.
                  Unlike "View teammate" it does
                  not duplicate the card's own action, and unlike Budget it is
                  not per-teammate configuration that reads better on a
                  detail page — it is the one roster-level action an operator
                  reaches for while scanning many cards deciding which to
                  prune, and moving it off the grid would trade a fast,
                  discoverable one-hop delete for an extra full-page
                  navigation with no offsetting benefit.

 * ({@link TINYHUMANS_API_KEYS_URL}, shared with the wizard so the two cannot
 * point at different pages).
 *
 * ## What it writes
 *
 * `PUT …/credential`, which stores `tinyhumans/key` and stops. That is the
 * company's TinyHumans identity, and since #2266 the slot a managed turn
 * resolves through. It does **not** declare the managed provider — only the
 * grant (`finish_link`) does.
 *
 * Deliberately minimal (operator request, 2026-09-14): a heading, the field,
 * the "Get an API key" link, Save and Cancel, and an error only when a save
 * fails. No explanatory paragraph.
 *
 * Write-only, like every credential the console handles: the value is never
 * returned, so the field opens empty every time and "set" is reported by a
 * flag rather than by a masked value we would have had to receive.

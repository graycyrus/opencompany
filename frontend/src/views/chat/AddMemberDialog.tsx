 * refused. Four states in a create dialog, three of which existed to recover
 * from the other one.
 *
 * A teammate is not finished at the moment it is created, and this dialog was
 * the only place pretending otherwise. What it needs is enough to make a real
 * record the operator can then open: who they are, what they look like on a
 * roster of thirteen, and what they do. Everything else — the description, the
 * persona, the tools, the model — is on the teammate's own page, next to the
 * copilot that drafts it and the record it is grounded in.
 *
 * So this creates and gets out of the way: the write lands and the operator is
 * put on the new agent's page, which is where the fine-tuning was always going
 * to happen.

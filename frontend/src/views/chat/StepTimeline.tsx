 * reply). Ported from the retired Conversation page (issue #246) so the chat
 * workspace keeps the same tool-call visibility it had.
 *

 * #367): there the rows are the content — they are what says the company is
 * working and on what — so they start open rather than behind a count. A
 * finished reply's steps stay collapsed, where they are supporting detail.

/**
 * Which moves each seat may open a line with.
 *
 * The knob that turns a vote back into a deliberation. A room whose members may
 * all `!propose` produces independent proposals and a commit — which is what a
 * live six-seat run produced in every one of nine episodes — because a proposal
 * already counts as its own author's support, so agreement is reached without
 * anybody engaging with anybody else's reasoning.
 *
 * # Three seat states, not a boolean
 *
 * "Not named" and "named with an empty list" both mean *every move*, and the
 * host reads them identically — an empty list is a table somebody started and
 * never filled in far more often than it is a vow of silence. But only one of
 * them is a decision somebody made, so the matrix shows the difference: a seat
 * the table does not govern reads "every move", not nine ticked boxes that
 * imply somebody chose them.
 *
 * # The ungated three are shown, not hidden
 *
 * `commit`, `question` and `defer` can never be taken away, and rendering them
 * as absent would read as "this seat cannot commit". A six-member desk once
 * reached quorum, handed the Commit floor to three seats barred from
 * committing, and reported itself exhausted on an answer it had already
 * decided — so the column exists precisely to say it cannot happen.

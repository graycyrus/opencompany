/**
 * The company's in-flight runs, with the controls each one supports, above the
 * composer in a Room.
 *
 * ## Why the runs arrive as a prop
 *
 * The shell already reads `GET …/tasks/inflight` on the company poll and on
 * every task-lifecycle tick. A second reader here would double that traffic and
 * give two surfaces two different answers to "what is running", so the shell
 * owns the read and this renders it.
 *
 * ## Why it is company-scoped inside a room
 *
 * A run carries no conversation id, so there is no honest way to say which room
 * a delegation belongs to. The choice is between showing the company's runs in
 * every room and showing them nowhere; a runaway sub-agent the operator cannot
 * stop is the worse of the two. The heading says "company" so the list does not
 * read as "this channel's work".
 *
 * ## Why a row is keyed on `run.key`
 *
 * Every run in the in-flight read is steerable by its `key`, and a delegation's
 * `taskId` is null. Keying a row on the card would drop exactly the runs that
 * have no other control.

 * in channel A followed by a pause for the SAME agent in channel B overwrites
 * A's marker with B's, regardless of which channel either happened in. This
 * used to be computed from a single channel's `items` inside `MessageTimeline`
 * — correct for the channel that is actually open, but wrong for any OTHER
 * channel holding an older notice for an agent who has since paused again
 * elsewhere: reopening that channel, its own last notice still reads as the
 * newest ONE IT has seen, so the "Add credits & resend" button stayed
 * enabled — and clicking it silently redeemed the newer, different-channel
 * marker and resent that unrelated message under the stale card.
 *
 * Folding over every channel in `transcripts` (which `AppShell` keeps live
 * for the whole company over SSE, not merely the currently open one) is what
 * actually matches the backend's one-marker-per-agent truth. Sorted by each
 * message's own `at` timestamp rather than by scan order, because iterating
 * one channel's array to completion before moving to the next would NOT
 * yield cross-channel chronological order on its own.
 *
 * Scanned with `isAnyBudgetPauseNotice`, NOT `isBudgetPauseNotice` (issue
 * #1906). The narrow check is the render-time one — "does this notice get an
 * Add-credits button" — and filtering the supersession map through it made
 * every NO-RESEND notice invisible here, while the marker it parked still
 * overwrote the previous one on the host. maya pauses on an interactive turn
 * (redeemable notice N1, marker M1); an approval for maya is then approved,
 * its continuation runs through `run_steered_background`, pauses, and parks M2
 * (`background: true`) over M1 with a no-resend notice. N1 was still this
 * map's answer for maya, so its CTA stayed enabled and clicking it sent
 * `?id=M1.id` — a marker that no longer exists — for a `RedeemMatch::Stale`
 * 409 that refreshing could never clear. A pause is a pause for supersession
 * purposes whether or not the operator gets a button for it.

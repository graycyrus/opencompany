/**
 * One room, in the transcript.
 *
 * A desk of two or more does not answer with a reply — it opens an **episode**
 * and runs a bounded sequence of single turns until it converges, deadlocks,
 * spends its budget, or finds it has nothing to say. Rendered as a flat list
 * those turns are indistinguishable from three agents talking, which is what the
 * console did before this block existed and is precisely the thing an operator
 * cannot afford to misread: three agents agreeing in parallel is not
 * deliberation.
 *
 * So the block draws the three facts a flat list cannot carry:
 *
 * - **which turns were blind**, because independence is the property a room
 *   actually buys over a single responder;
 * - **what the turns added up to**, so "is this decided yet" does not require
 *   holding six citations in your head;
 * - **how it ended**, in the desk's own words.
 *
 * The closing report is rendered *only* as the verdict card. It is excluded from
 * the row list rather than shown twice — as a grey system line and again as the
 * verdict — which is what it looked like before the exclusion.

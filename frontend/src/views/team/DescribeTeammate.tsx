/**
 * The reduced Add-teammate dialog's whole content (issue #1989): a name and one
 * box.
 *
 * Shared by both Add-teammate dialogs — the roster grid's
 * (`TeamView.AddMemberDialog`, which also offers a budget) and the chat/org
 * chart's (`views/chat/AddMemberDialog`) — because the reduction is the same
 * reduction, and two copies of it would drift the way the two full forms
 * already have. What each dialog keeps to itself is what it does with the
 * result: the org chart also places the teammate on a desk, and the roster grid
 * also refetches.
 *
 * ## Why a Name field beside the box, when the brief said one box
 *
 * Because nothing can derive a name. The copilot's `DraftableField` is
 * `description | instructions` and excludes `name` deliberately, so there is no
 * model in this path to name anybody; the only alternative is splitting the
 * sentence, and a teammate's name is not a phrase. "Runs paid acquisition"
 * would then be the name on every roster card, in every member list, and beside
 * every message that teammate sends. The role is not split out of the sentence
 * either — it is designed from it, by the model, in the same pass as the
 * mandate and the persona. See `team-add-surface.ts` for why a split cannot do
 * that job at all.
 *
 * ## Why there is no copilot control in here
 *
 * Because the copilot is not a control on this dialog — it is what Create does.
 * `POST {scope}/team/design` turns this box into a role, a mandate and a
 * persona in one pass, and the teammate is written from that; there is no field
 * for an operator to ask about separately, because there is only one box and it
 * is theirs. The redirect afterwards lands them on all three fields, editable,
 * so a designed role is read before it can matter — which is the whole reason
 * the redirect is load-bearing rather than a nicety.

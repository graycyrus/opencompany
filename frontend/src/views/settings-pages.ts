// section — which imports every view under it, and would import itself back
// through them. `device-pairing.tsx` is the case that forced it: it tells a
// desktop user where to go, and for one release it told them to go somewhere
// that did not exist (issue #1476). Directions read from this table cannot say
// that again — a page id that is not here is a type error.

  //
  // Two of those three then left this rail entirely: third-party accounts (as
  // **Apps**) and MCP servers are the Connections section now, at
  // `#/connections/apps` and `#/connections/mcp`, because what the company can
  // act through is something an operator reads repeatedly rather than

  // resolve, rewritten onto the section by `console-route-rewrites.ts`, so

  // stated twice in this file: a credential form belongs beside the one thing

  // would separate each credential from what it is for.

  // ask a question *about* the company rather than to work in it — and beside
  // Skills, which is the other half of the same pair: what teammates are told
  // to do, and what they did.
  //
  // This row is a doorway, not the address. `#/settings/observatory` is
  // rewritten straight back onto `#/observatory` by `console-route-rewrites.ts`
  // — the Observatory reads four query keys off the hash and keys them on its
  // head being `observatory`, so under `#/settings/…` its analytics tab and its
  // agent/turn selection stop being addressable. A single run keeps the same
  // top-level shape, `#/observatory/<runId>`, because workflow rows, approval
  // cards and chat all link straight to one — burying that behind a settings
  // rail would break every link that names a run.

  // are configuration, and what the company remembers is not configuration.
  // `#/settings/brain` still resolves, rewritten onto the row by
  // `console-route-rewrites.ts`, so every link minted while it lived here works.

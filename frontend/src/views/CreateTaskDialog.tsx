// columns, but a ledger's own compose box is `record_entry` — which the host
// refuses for this ledger, because entering a column fires real work. So
// creation keeps its own dialog, posting to `…/tasks` exactly as it always did,
// and Ledgers offers it only for the native board.
//
// Its labels, ids and headings are unchanged on purpose: "Add task",
// "New task", `#new-prompt`. They are what the e2e suite drives, and moving a
// dialog between screens should not rewrite the vocabulary an operator (or a
// test) already knows.

 * the transcript's "Add to board" relies on, keeping the human drag into In
 * progress the only thing that spends an agent turn.
 *
 * Three fields are collected beyond the prompt.
 *
 * The **deliverable** (issue #580): once versus workflow is a decision about
 * *what kind of thing* the card produces, not a default the host can pick, so
 * the operator states it here. It still lands in To-do like any card — the
 * builder pass fires only on the drag into In progress.
 *
 * The **priority** (issue #1357): a card's priority is its most prominent
 * visual signal, so an operator who knows the urgency states it when creating
 * the card. It defaults to medium, preserving the host's historical default.
 *
 * The **owner** (issue #1106). Assignee was moved out by #301 on the reasoning
 * that the host defaults it and the card edits it. What that missed is what the
 * host's default actually is: an unassigned card is routed by a planning pass
 * that picks from the roster, and when two teammates plausibly fit it picked one
 * with nothing recorded about the other. Offering the picker here is the
 * *pre-empt* for that — an operator who knows the owner states it once and never
 * meets the ambiguity prompt #1106 adds. It defaults to unassigned, so a quick
 * card is exactly as quick as before and today's routing stays the default
 * rather than becoming a choice forced on every card.

// The Brain section's sub-page table, and the helpers that read it.
//
// A leaf module, exactly as `views/connection-pages.ts`, `views/settings-pages.ts`
// and `views/finance/finance-pages.ts` are, and for the same reason: the nav
// table has to name these pages, and a static import of `MemoryView` from there
// would pull the whole memory browser — its virtual list, its dialogs, its
// engine section — into a module the sidebar renders on every route.
//
// # Why Brain is three tabs
//
// It was one page: the engine picker, then the drop zone, then the browser,
// stacked in a column. An operator arriving to answer "does it already know
// this" — which is what this surface is for, and the reason it left the
// settings rail (issue #1416) — scrolled past a provider form and an upload
// target to reach it, every time. The three do not change at the same rate
// either: the engine is set once and then almost never, an upload happens when
// a document arrives, the browser is read constantly.
//
// So they were split into three rail rows. That over-corrected. Three rows
// under a caption said Brain was three destinations, when it is one subject —
// what the company remembers — looked at three ways, and it spent three of the
// sidebar's scarce rows saying so. They are tabs in the page's own header now
// (`components/page-tabs.tsx`), and Brain is one row again.
//
// # The addresses did not change
//
// `#/company/brain/upload` still opens Upload. Unlike the pages that carry
// their tab in `?tab=`, Brain's tabs stay on the path segment they already
// owned: these were real addresses the sidebar deep-linked and operators
// bookmarked, and a query-string move would have retired every one of them to
// buy nothing. `PageTabs` is controlled, so what a page routes its tabs
// through is the page's own business.

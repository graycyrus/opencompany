/**
 * The company talking to itself: who may reach whom, who has, and who made whom.
 *
 * Pure — nodes and edges out of a roster, a desk list, and whatever the live
 * stream has said so far — so the interesting cases (a wildcard allowlist, a
 * hand-off whose target is redacted, two dispatches to one desk) are testable
 * without a browser or a host.
 *
 * # Why the edges come from four places
 *
 * There is no endpoint that answers "which agents talk to each other". The host
 * carries the pieces and nothing joins them:
 *
 * - **`delegates_to`** is the *address space* — the desks a teammate may hand
 *   work to. Declared, so it is drawable before a company has ever run. Without
 *   it a graph of a fresh company is a set of unconnected dots, which is not
 *   what its manifest says.
 * - **Desk membership** is who shares a room, and therefore who can answer whom.
 * - **`task_dispatched` → `desk_task_completed`** is a delegation that actually
 *   happened, and the only pair the journal already correlates.
 * - **`tool_call` frames** name the rest: `add_agent` (a spawn), `spawn_task`,
 *   `delegate_to_desk`, `delegate_to_teammate`.
 *
 * The last of those is the weakest and is treated as such. A tool call's
 * arguments reach the console **redacted** (`TurnStep.detail`), so the target may
 * simply not be readable — in which case the edge is recorded with an unknown
 * target rather than guessed at. A graph that invents an edge is worse than one
 * that admits a gap.

// The drawer a FAILED run leaves behind (issue #1007).
//
// `RunResultPanel` next door is the surface for a run that produced something,
// and it can only mount when the settled body arrives — which on the failure
// path it never does. So a failed run had no drawer, no row and no error text:
// the console went back to its resting state behind a toast that lasted four
// seconds. This is the same slot, for the outcome that had nothing in it.
//
// Deliberately a panel and not a toast, on the same rule the version-conflict
// banner and the inference refusal already follow: an outcome the operator has
// to act on — read the message, look at the history row, fix the graph, run it
// again — must outlive the glance.

// Which of the company's parked approvals belong to the run on screen (#1002).
//
// The run drawer already *tells* an operator their run stopped for a person —
// the parked badge and the "Not finished — …" sentence (#880 / #881) — and gave
// them nowhere to act: `resolveApproval` was reachable from the Approvals page
// and the shell alone, so deciding meant leaving the run, finding the row in a
// flat queue, and coming back. This is the join that lets a second surface ask
// the same question the page asks, narrowed to one run.
//
// ## Purely additive
//
// Nothing here filters the queue. These helpers take the queue the Approvals
// page and the sidebar badge already read (`feed.approvals`) and *select* from
// it for one run; the page keeps showing every row, and the badge keeps
// counting every row. An approval no workflow run parked — a chat turn, a
// scheduler tick, a task attempt — matches nothing here and belongs to the page
// alone, exactly as it did before this shipped.
//
// ## Live, never a snapshot
//
// The run body carries its own receipt of what it parked
// (`WorkflowRunApprovalRow`), and that receipt is deliberately frozen: #880
// wrote it as "this run opened this card", never as "this card is still
// waiting". Deriving the drawer's blocking list from it would go stale the
// instant anyone decided anything, anywhere. So the *rows* come from the live
// queue and the receipt is used only for the one thing it is authoritative
// about — which node a card was parked by.

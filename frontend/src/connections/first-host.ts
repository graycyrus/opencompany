// What to say to somebody who has no host at all.
//
// The one screen where "where does my company run" is not a setting but the
// only question there is, and — before connectors — the one screen that
// answered it by pointing at a control somewhere else.
//
// ## Two situations, and they are not the same absence
//
// The desktop reaches this when the host inside it did not start: usually
// another copy of the application, or an `opencompany serve` in a terminal,
// holding the data root. Something went wrong, and the operator can fix it.
//
// A **hub** reaches it by simply being new. Its own origin serves assets and
// nothing else (`hub-console.md`), so a hub that nobody has added a host to
// yet holds zero connections and always did. Nothing went wrong, and the
// desktop's copy — "the host on this computer didn't start" — describes a
// computer that was never going to run one.
//
// The same words for both is how a first run reads as a failure.
//
// See `docs/spec/runtime/connectors.md`.

   * because a hub runs none and the answer is genuinely elsewhere.

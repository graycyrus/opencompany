// Whether this deployment can actually run the MCP servers its console manages
// (issue #567).
//
// The `/mcp/servers` management routes ship in every build; the agent-side
// registry is pushed onto a teammate's tool belt behind the `mcp` Cargo feature.
// So a build without it accepts a server, stores its token and reports it
// healthy — and no agent ever receives a single tool from it. The console has to
// state that, because every other reading on the screen looks correct: on a
// build with the harness but without the bridge, live tool discovery and health
// probes answer for real.
//
// The three-state answer matters more than it looks. `mcpInBuild` is optional on
// the wire: a host predating the field sends nothing, and rendering that silence
// as "no teammate can use these" would be a fresh lie in the other direction. Only
// an explicit `false` is absence.

 * any of them — reachability rendered as delivery. `HostingView` solved the same
 * shape by folding `inBuild` into its `connected` expression; this does the
 * equivalent for MCP. On `bridge === "absent"` every affirmative reading drops
 * out of the success colour into the neutral `configured` register — the badge
 * then says the same thing as the banner. `needs_config` / `error` are real
 * problems either way and keep their own registers. `unknown` (an older host, or
 * a failed capability read) is treated as delivering: claiming non-delivery
 * there would be the #567 lie in the other direction.

 * Returns `null` when there is nothing to show — never probed and no stored

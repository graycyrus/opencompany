// Where a view lives in the address, as opposed to what a view is.
//
// `console-routes.ts` answers "does this surface route at all". This answers
// "what does its address look like", and the two are deliberately separate: a
// view's id is its identity and never changes, while its *path* is a statement
// about how the console is organised and has changed twice already.
//
// # The prefix
//
// Company's surfaces used to be top-level addresses — `#/ledgers`, `#/brain`,
// `#/workspace`, `#/finances` — while being drawn as Company's pages in both
// the sidebar and the content rail. The navigation said one thing and the
// address bar said another, so a link nobody could place ("what is
// `#/ledgers`?") named a page every operator knows as Company → Work.
//
// They are `#/company/<page>` now. The view ids are untouched: `ledgers` is
// still the view, `work` is only what it is called in a URL, exactly as "Work"
// is only what it is called on a row. See `COMPANY_PAGES`.
//
// # Old addresses still resolve
//
// Not through a rewrite table — through {@link parseConsolePath} returning
// `null` for anything that is not prefixed, which drops the address into the
// router's ordinary head/sub resolution, which is what it always did. So every
// `#/ledgers/goals` and `#/team/<id>` link ever minted keeps working, and the
// router's `canonicalize` quietly replaces it with the prefixed form on
// arrival. Nothing has to enumerate the old spellings.

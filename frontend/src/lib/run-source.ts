// Where a run came from (issue #1573).
//
// A teammate's run history is a list of attempts, and an attempt on its own
// says almost nothing: "succeeded, 41s, 12 steps" is not an answer to "what was
// it doing". What makes the list readable is the *provenance* — this one worked
// a card, that one answered a message in #front-desk, that one was a step in
// the nightly digest workflow.
//
// # None of that is on the run record, and that is deliberate
//
// A `RunSummary` carries a `taskId` **or** a `chatId` and nothing else, because
// those are the only two things the dispatch path knows at the moment it mints
// the row. Everything richer — the card's title, the workflow that opened the
// card, the channel's display name — belongs to surfaces that outlive, and are
// edited independently of, the attempt.
//
// So the source is *resolved*, from lists the console already reads, rather
// than denormalised onto the run at write time. That has one property worth
// stating plainly: **it degrades**. A card that has been deleted, a workflow
// that has been retired, a host too old to send `originWorkflowId` — each of
// those lands here as a run whose source is known only by id. This module says
// so in those cases instead of guessing, because a confident wrong provenance
// ("Card: Draft the Q3 memo") on an attempt that was actually something else is
// worse than an honest `card-8f2a`.
//
// # Why a workflow beats a card
//
// A card opened by a workflow run is both a card and a workflow step. The
// workflow wins the headline because it is the thing that *decided* the work —
// the card is the mechanism it used, and it is still named, on the second line.
// The reverse ordering would file every scheduled run under a card title nobody
// wrote and hide the schedule that is actually generating them.

/**
 * How the deliberation vocabulary is rendered.
 *
 * Pure — a projection from a move or an ending to the label, the icon name and
 * the class strings that draw it — so every visual decision here is unit-testable
 * in the node lane with no React tree.
 *
 * # Three rules this file exists to keep
 *
 * **A move is told apart by its shape, never by its colour.** Roughly one in
 * twelve men cannot separate a red/green pair, and nine move kinds is far past
 * what any palette separates honestly anyway. So every move chip takes the same
 * neutral treatment and differs by icon and label. That also means this file
 * introduces **no new colour token**, which keeps `docs/design-system/color.md`'s
 * cleared-debt grep green.
 *
 * **An ending borrows the closed status vocabulary and never extends it.** The
 * five states — idle, running, blocked, done, failed — carry measured contrast
 * ratios; a sixth hue invented for "deadlocked" would carry none.
 *
 * **A topic is a third form.** Identity is a tile with initials, status is a pill
 * with a dot, and neither may be reused for "which option is this" — the design
 * system's own rule is that identity and status never take the same shape, and a
 * topic is a third kind of thing again. It gets a `#`-prefixed monospace chip.
 *
 * Class strings are written out in full and never assembled from a template,
 * because Tailwind finds classes by scanning source text — a computed
 * `bg-status-${key}` is silently never generated.

/**
 * Folding a desk transcript back into the episodes it recorded.
 *
 * A deliberating desk journals nothing but its own turns: one reply per turn
 * under the teammate that spoke, then one closing row under `hive-report`
 * (`docs/spec/runtime/hivemind.md`, "What lands in the journal"). There is no
 * episode record and no second store — **the transcript is the episode**, which
 * is what makes the standings impossible to disagree with the conversation they
 * were folded from.
 *
 * So the console reconstructs rather than reads. This module is that fold: pure,
 * over the `ChatMessage[]` the transcript already holds, producing the topics,
 * supporters, citations and ending a room reached.
 *
 * # Everything here is an approximation, and says so
 *
 * The host folds with `tinyhivemind_hive`, which this file deliberately does not
 * reimplement in full — it has an attention market, a salience model and a
 * windowed quorum that a console has no business restating. What it reproduces
 * is the part an operator reads: who proposed what, who backed it with what
 * grounds, who objected to whom, and how it ended.
 *
 * Every episode is therefore marked {@link Episode.derived}. Where the host's own
 * closing sentence is present it is the authority, and {@link Episode.ending} is
 * taken from it verbatim rather than from our count — our standings are shown
 * beside it, never in place of it. {@link Episode.disagrees} records when the two
 * differ, so a mismatch is visible rather than silently rendered as fact.
 *
 * When the typed episode frames land this module keeps its shape and loses its
 * guesswork: `derived` flips false and the ending arrives rather than being
 * parsed.

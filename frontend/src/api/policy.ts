// The autonomy-tier API (issue #562): the console reads and writes the
// company's effective `[policy]` through the host's `.../policy` routes (REST,
// camelCase over the wire).
//
// The effective policy is the operator's console override where it sets a
// field, and the committed manifest `[policy]` everywhere else. The console
// never writes the manifest — a rebuild re-persists that from the seed, and for
// `[policy]` that is a deliberate security property — so a change here is a
// durable, attributed *override* the host resolves ahead of the manifest.
//
// Standalone functions over the shared client (mirrors `api/inference.ts`), so
// no change to `OpenCompanyClient` or the shared `api/types.ts` is needed.

/**
 * What a *renderable* policy is, as distinct from what the host sent.
 *
 * ## The crash this fences
 *
 * A 200 whose body is not a policy used to reach the render untouched, and the
 * first `status.tiers.find(...)` threw. `AutonomyPill` is mounted for the entire
 * life of the console on every view (`window-title-bar.tsx`), there is no error
 * boundary anywhere in `src/`, and React unmounts the whole tree on a throw
 * during render — so one malformed `/policy` response blanked the ENTIRE
 * console, on every page, with no way back but a reload. The console E2E lane
 * met it as `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'find')`
 * against an empty document, and thirty-plus specs sat on their timeouts.
 *
 * ## Why it is a predicate here and not a check on the fetch
 *
 * Because "usable" depends on the reader. `useApprovalDeadline` wants
 * `approvalTtlHours` and documents that an older host omits it; making the
 * transport insist on the tier list would break a hook that is deliberately
 * lenient. So the three functions below stay plain typed requests and each
 * consumer that puts a policy ON SCREEN gates on this instead — `useAutonomy`
 * for the title row, `apply`/`load` for the settings page.
 *
 * ## Why these three fields and no more
 *
 * They are exactly what the render paths dereference without a guard —
 * `tiers.find`, `tiers.map`, `alwaysApprove.join` — plus the `mode` they
 * compare against. Every optional field stays optional: this is a crash fence,
 * not a schema, and a host that grows or drops a field must keep working. See
 * `knownTools` above.
 *
 * The two required lists are checked to their MEMBERS, though, because the
 * container check alone does not fence what it is here to fence: `tiers: [null]`
 * is an array, passes, and throws inside `tiers.find` on the very next line —
 * the same blank console this predicate was written to stop. See
 * {@link isPolicyTier}.

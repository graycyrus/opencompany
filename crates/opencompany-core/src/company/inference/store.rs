//! Provider records and their credential slots, over the [`SecretStore`] port.
//!
//! This module knows two things: where a provider record lives, and where its
//! credential lives. It knows nothing about HTTP, and nothing about which
//! provider is *right* for a request — that is [`resolve`](super::resolve)'s
//! job. Everything here is exercised against an in-memory store, with no host.
//!
//! ## Entry zero — why the flat legacy slot stays exactly where it is
//!
//! A company's stored console override and credential already live at
//! [`RUNTIME_CONFIG_KEY`](super::RUNTIME_CONFIG_KEY) and
//! [`KEY_KEY`](super::KEY_KEY), and **the store has no rename**. Namespacing
//! every provider under a new prefix would orphan the config of every company
//! already running — the one migration this design cannot afford, and the code
//! said so before this module existed.
//!
//! So the flat slot is not migrated. It *is* the first element of the list:
//!
//! ```text
//!   inference/config   ──▶  entry zero   (legacy, never moved, never indexed)
//!   inference/key      ──▶  its credential
//!
//!   inference/providers ─▶  the index: every OTHER provider, no credentials
//!   provider/<slug>/key ─▶  one credential slot per provider
//! ```
//!
//! The cost is one special case in the reader, forever. That is cheaper than a
//! migration on a store with no transaction, where a half-completed run leaves a
//! company with neither config.
//!
//! ## Why an index blob rather than a key scan
//!
//! The design sketch reads the list as `list("provider/*/config")`. **The
//! [`SecretStore`] port has no `list`** — it is `get` and `set` and nothing
//! else, and widening a port every backend must implement (including the
//! database-per-tenant MongoDB one) to enumerate secrets by prefix is a much
//! larger change than this feature justifies, and a worse one: prefix
//! enumeration over a secret store is a capability with no other caller.
//!
//! So the records live together in one indexed blob and only the *credentials*
//! are keyed per slug. This also makes an add atomic in the way that matters: a
//! provider appears in the list in one `set`, rather than a company being able
//! to observe half a record.
//!
//! ## And no delete, either
//!
//! The port cannot delete. Clearing is a write of the empty string that reads
//! back as unset, so "cleared" and "never set" are the same state. That is
//! workable, but it means a clear must actually be **issued** rather than
//! inferred — which is why [`delete_provider`] clears the credential explicitly
//! and says so loudly when the clear fails. Leaving a `provider/<slug>/key`
//! behind is not untidiness: re-adding that slug would silently inherit a
//! credential the operator thought they had removed.

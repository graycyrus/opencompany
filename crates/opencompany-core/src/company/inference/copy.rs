//! Shared turn-failure and save-refusal sentences (decision D-copy / X9,
//! 2026-09-15, `docs/key-reworks/README.md`).
//!
//! Before this module, near-identical fail-closed sentences were written out
//! by hand at each call site (`resolve_choice` in `inference.rs`, the agent
//! pin check in `harness/built_in/provider.rs`, the provider save routes in
//! `server/ops/inference/providers.rs` and `server/ops/team_agent.rs`), and
//! nothing kept them in agreement — two sites saying the same thing slightly
//! differently reads, to an operator hopping between an agent's error and the
//! company default's error, as two different products. One function per
//! sentence, called from every site that needs it, is the fix; the tests
//! below are what keep it a fix rather than a fourth copy.
//!
//! D-names-in-errors (X7) is why every function here takes a **display
//! name** — an agent's `role`/label, a provider's `label` — never a raw slug
//! or agent id. The id still rides in whatever structured data the caller
//! attaches (an `AgentPin` carries both); only the sentence a person reads is
//! restricted to names.

/// Why a provider a pin or the default named cannot serve a turn.

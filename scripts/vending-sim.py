"""Run Northgate Vending as a live scenario: a world, a clock, and three desks.

This is the vending-machine counterpart to ``scripts/hive-euler.py``. Where that
one states a problem and grades the answer, this one runs a **business**: it
starts the simulated world behind an MCP server, registers that server with a
running company, then advances the clock a day at a time — posting each day's
triggers into the desk that owns them and waiting for the room to answer.

What it is for is the thing a unit test cannot show: whether real models seated
on three desks, given a fleet that is genuinely too big for the van, actually
**talk to each other**. The run counts both seams this bundle exists to
exercise — cross-desk referrals, and the private asides the ops desk may open —
and prints the text of every referral, because a run in which the desks never
speak to each other looks exactly like a healthy one from the margin alone.

Stdlib only, so it runs wherever ``python3`` does. Talks to a running
``opencompany serve`` (default ``http://127.0.0.1:8080``) whose auth mode is
``none``, or signs in as the manifest admin through the dev-code flow.

    # the whole thing, defaults
    python3 scripts/vending-sim.py --days 14

    # a longer run, persisting the world so it can be resumed
    python3 scripts/vending-sim.py --days 30 --state /tmp/vending.json --out run.json

Exit status is the number of days on which no desk produced a decision, so a
CI-style caller can treat zero as "the company was awake the whole time".

# Hosting Cortex behind the memory seam

A design record for [#1936](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/opencompany/issues/1936):
can we host [`tinycortex`](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/tinycortex) ourselves and
let tenants bind to it through the `remote` seam, on equal footing with
`supermemory`, `mem0` and `cognee`?

Companion to [`memory-engine.md`](memory-engine.md), which specifies the seam this
would bind through. **That document describes what ships; this one describes a
proposal and the measurements behind it.**

`cortex` is a **selectable** engine as of #2065 — the driver from
[tinymemory#128](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/tinymemory/pull/128) is
registered, and both live suites pass against a real CortexDB. Selectable is not
selected: `OPENCOMPANY_MEMORY` defaults exactly as it did, and choosing Cortex is
the decision this record informs. It argues against it — with one leg of that argument
[retracted](#correction-2026-09-04) and one
[hardened](memory-engine-cortex-evidence.md#the-scope-bypass-re-measured-2026-09-09).

## Correction (2026-09-04)

**Finding 3 below is overturned, not merely withdrawn. The derived fact and
belief tier works.** It was measured on a server with enrichment switched off,
and on v0.9.8 nothing on the wire said so.

CortexDB v0.9.9 (released 2026-09-03, after this record was written) adds
`embeddings`, `enrichment` and `content_processors` checks to
`GET /v1/admin/ready`, precisely because a server could report
`{"status":"healthy"}` and `degraded: false` while underdelivering. Ours
answered `enrichment: { "enabled": false, "mode": "off" }`.

Three prerequisites were unset, none discoverable on v0.9.8:

1. `CORTEX_ENRICHMENT_URL` / `_API_KEY` — the enrichment router is a separate
   lane from `CORTEX_LLM_*`. `_MODEL` alone gives it a model with no endpoint.
2. `CORTEX_ENTITY_API_KEY` — the binary is explicit that "both the primary
   entity LLM and enrichment router are required". Without it, boot logs
   `LLM router not configured` even with `CORTEX_LLM_URL`/`_MODEL` both set.
3. `CORTEX_ENRICHMENT_DELAY_SECONDS` — **the on/off gate**. Unset means
   enrichment is off entirely: "events/episodes/recall only".

A first re-run still indexed 0 facts, because the embedding provider was
answering `402 Insufficient credits`. With that fixed — 120 embedding calls,
0 failures — **10 events produced 19 facts and 9 beliefs**, as
subject/predicate/object triples with resolved entities and confidence:

```text
ent_Aniketh                  prefers  "evidence over product-page claims"
ent_tinymemory_cortex_driver folds    "newest-per-key on read"     conf 1.0
```

So the commercial argument against Cortex — that it offers nothing the
incumbents do not — does not hold. It offers this.

**Nothing replaces it.** A follow-up claim that beliefs never revise was filed as
[#2089](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/opencompany/issues/2089) and withdrawn:
`/docs/api-reference/facts` supersedes on the same `(subject, predicate)`, and
the two claims we compared had different subjects. Details on the
[evidence page](memory-engine-cortex-evidence.md#belief-revision--finding-withdrawn).
Understanding stays empty, and the concepts lane still reports no LLM router with
both routers verifiably started — the one defect here that has survived
checking.

Finding 2's conclusion is untouched and its reasoning is now stronger — see
[the re-measurement](memory-engine-cortex-evidence.md#the-scope-bypass-re-measured-2026-09-09).
It *forces* instance-per-tenant rather than blocking it, removing the
shared-instance-with-per-tenant-credentials row from the topology table. The
decision taken on [#2072](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/opencompany/issues/2072)
is to adopt at that topology.

## Findings first

A CortexDB instance was deployed and exercised to answer this from evidence
rather than from the product page. Five results change the shape of the
question, and the recommendation follows from them.

1. **`tinyhumansai/tinycortex` is not the deployable artifact.** It is a Rust
   *library* crate — no binary target, no server, no Dockerfile. The server is
   **closed-source**, distributed only as prebuilt artifacts (`cortexdbai/cortexdb-releases`,
   Docker Hub `cortexdb/cortexdb`). Whatever we build treats it as an opaque
   upstream binary we cannot patch.
2. **The isolating configuration is not reachable self-hosted, and two routes
   bypass the boundary outright.** `CORTEX_V1_MINTER_ENABLE=1` turns on
   `POST /v1/auth/tokens`, which mints correctly. A token minted *for* scope A,
   pointed at scope B: `/v1/recall` and `/v1/forget` are refused
   `403 POLICY_DENIED`, but `GET /v1/events?scope=B` returns B's records and
   `POST /v1/experience` into B is accepted and stored. The documented way to
   narrow an actor, `PUT /v1/policy/{tier}`, is experimental and `404`s here.
   ~~This is the deployment tier behaving as configured.~~ **It is not** —
   re-run on v0.9.9 with narrowed tokens holding none of the capabilities that
   would explain it, the same two routes still leak while their neighbours
   refuse the identical request. `aud` cannot separate tenants within an
   instance either: it is one value per *deployment*. Both are set out in
   [the re-measurement](memory-engine-cortex-evidence.md#the-scope-bypass-re-measured-2026-09-09).
   The conclusion is the one this record already drew, for a stronger reason:
   nothing here may rest on Cortex's scopes.
3. ~~**The derived fact and belief tier does not work.**~~ **Overturned — see
   [Correction](#correction-2026-09-04).** The run below had enrichment off and
   no way to report it; configured, and on a funded provider account, Facts and
   Beliefs do build. What still holds is the structural half: these are Cortex
   *layers*, not contract capability families, so the audit cannot fire on them
   however empty they are.
4. **Retrieval quality is real, and comes from embeddings alone.** Ranked recall
   over the Events layer is good and needs no LLM lanes at all.
5. **The contract's upsert has no direct mapping, but a conformant driver is
   reachable.** `(namespace, key)` replacement cannot be expressed against an
   append-only log with immutable keys. It can be *reconstructed*: append every
   write under a fresh idempotency key carrying the logical key, and fold to
   newest-per-key on read. That driver exists and passes. Its cost — set out in
   [the driver notes](memory-engine-cortex-driver.md) — is what should decide
   this, not impossibility.

## The isolation choice collapses

The issue frames a choice between Cortex-DB-per-tenant and one shared Cortex
with namespace-only separation, and says to default to the stronger. Finding 2
removes the middle option:

| Option | Isolation tier | Reachable self-hosted? |
|---|---|---|
| One shared instance, one bootstrap credential | Namespace-only — the **weak** tier | Yes |
| **One instance per tenant**, own key and own data dir | Credential *and* storage isolation | **Yes** |
| Shared instance, real per-tenant credentials | Strong | **No** — `aud` is one value per deployment, so a shared instance is a *single* Cortex tenant, and the scope boundary it falls back on is bypassed on `/v1/events` and `/v1/experience` (finding 2) |

`memory-engine.md` is unambiguous about why the weak tier is not acceptable as a
default: with a hosted engine "the namespace string is the only thing separating
tenants inside somebody else's database", and the engine-level `memory migrate`
copies *every namespace a source credential can see*, which is "exactly wrong if
two tenants ever shared one".

**Recommendation: instance-per-tenant, co-located on shared infrastructure.** It
is the only self-hosted route to the tier the seam already assumes. Note what
this does to the issue's own framing: "shared hosting" becomes shared
*infrastructure*, not a shared engine process. The per-tenant Cortex credential
then slots into `OPENCOMPANY_MEMORY_API_KEY` exactly like any other hosted
engine's, and the migrate caution above is satisfied by construction.

## What Cortex would and would not replace

Worth stating plainly, because the two knobs are independent and it is easy to
read one as the other.

| Knob | Scope |
|---|---|
| `OPENCOMPANY_STORAGE` | the durable base for **all fourteen ports** — `fs`, `sqlite`, or `mongodb` |
| `OPENCOMPANY_MEMORY` | an optional overlay for **three of them** — `MemoryStore`, `ContextStore`, `FactStore` |

Where memory actually lives therefore depends on the overlay, not the base
alone:

- **`store` (default)** — memory reuses the base backend. Under
  `OPENCOMPANY_STORAGE=mongodb`, memory *is* in MongoDB. This is what tenants
  run today.
- **`embedded`/tinycortex (removed)** — memory lived in the engine's own
  filesystem workspace under `<OPENCOMPANY_DATA_DIR>/memory/`, **not** MongoDB.
  Selecting it alongside `OPENCOMPANY_STORAGE=mongodb` was a **boot refusal**,
  because `/data` is scratch in that mode and the memory would have been
  silently lost on restart.
- **`remote`** — memory lives in the hosted provider; the base backend keeps
  the other eleven ports.

So adopting Cortex is **not** replacing MongoDB. It carves three ports out of
the base backend and leaves the other eleven — companies, events, secrets,
tasks and the rest — exactly where they are. A tenant would run Mongo *and*
Cortex, each owning a disjoint set of ports.

That also bounds the blast radius of everything in this document: a Cortex
outage costs a tenant its knowledge ports, not its company records.

## Layers are not capability families

Moved to [the evidence page](memory-engine-cortex-evidence.md#layers-are-not-capability-families).
The short version: Cortex's five layers are an engine-internal model, not
families a driver advertises, so `audit_provider` cannot fire on them however
empty they are. The audit gap that is real, and is not about Cortex, is
[#1968](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/opencompany/issues/1968).

## The upsert gap, and the driver mechanics

The contract's `(namespace, key)` upsert has no direct mapping onto an
append-only log, and reconstructing it is most of what a driver does. That
argument, the measured table of failed direct mappings, what the workaround costs
at every call, and the engine behaviours that only appear against a running
instance are in
[`memory-engine-cortex-driver.md`](memory-engine-cortex-driver.md).

Two conclusions from it are load-bearing here. **A conformant driver is
reachable** — appending under a fresh idempotency key and folding to
newest-per-key on read passes the suite against a live engine. And **an upsert
alone would not make Cortex cheap**: keyed reads would still scan and writes
would still wait, because those need a metadata filter and a readiness signal
that are separate asks.

## Belief revision, and what does work

Both moved to [the evidence page](memory-engine-cortex-evidence.md). Retrieval
quality is real and comes from embeddings alone; the belief-revision finding was
**withdrawn** — see the correction there and
[#2089](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/opencompany/issues/2089).

## Fitting the seam's invariants

`memory-engine.md` makes several properties load-bearing. Three need work
host-side, because Cortex does not provide them:

- **Boot refuses rather than silently degrades.** Cortex does the opposite. With
  no embedding credential it does not refuse: it logs a warning, falls back to
  **mock embeddings**, pins the data directory to `mock::1536`, and reports
  `{"status":"healthy"}`. Recall then returns confident, meaningless results —
  the precise failure the seam's no-fallback rule exists to prevent. **A `cortex`
  driver must probe for the mock provider and refuse the bind itself.**
- **Class is decided by the host.** Unaffected — `remote` pins `External`, and
  nothing about Cortex self-reports class.
- **Credential and endpoint never logged.** Compatible: Cortex's own config
  surface redacts, and the host's `Debug` impls already handle this.
- **Host-owned policy** — archive-on-evict ordering, the scratch firewall,
  `ExternalSync` taint stamping, per-agent and per-desk scoping — all remain
  host-side and are unaffected by the engine choice. Cortex has its own
  provenance/taint notion; it is not the host's and should not be relied on.

## Infrastructure

**Deliberately incomplete.** #1936 asked for HA, backup/restore and an upgrade
path alongside sizing. They are absent by decision: they describe operating a
deployment this record recommends against, and belong with the Phase 0 decision.

Per-instance footprint is the open number. The binary's own config lint projects
**~18 GiB steady-state RAM** on a 3.9 GiB box, and that estimate did not move
under any remediation it suggests — probed across `CORTEX_VECTOR_RESIDENT_MAX`
at 150000 / 20000 / 5000, tenant shards on and off, and `CORTEX_VECTOR_SHARDS` at
8 and 2, all returning ~18 GiB. Idle RSS is ~27 MiB, so the projection is a
ceiling model rather than a floor, but **the real per-instance figure has to come
from Cortex before any capacity plan is credible**. Under instance-per-tenant
that number is multiplied by tenant count, which makes it the dominant cost term.

Other operational notes:

- `CORTEX_VECTOR_TENANT_SHARDS` latches on disk at pool creation
  (`pool_manifest.json`) — it must be set before real data lands.
- Changing embedding provider or dimension re-pins the data directory and
  requires wiping it. Vectors from two providers cannot be mixed.
- Per-call cost is negligible at evaluation scale: embeddings plus LLM lanes
  across ~50 events and several hours of scheduler ticks totalled **$0.000022**.
  Capability, not cost, is the constraint.

## Licensing permits this

Checked against the license text rather than the release README's one-line
summary, which is lossy in a way that matters. **CortexDB Community License
v1.0 clause 2** explicitly allows what this design does:

> The Software may be used to power internal or commercial applications,
> including those sold to third parties, provided that: (a) the third party
> does not access the Software directly as a general-purpose memory database
> (i.e., you may build products on top of CortexDB and sell those products; you
> may not resell CortexDB itself as a service); and (b) attribution to
> "CortexDB" appears in product documentation where reasonable.

Selling OpenCompany with Cortex behind the memory seam is building a product on
top of CortexDB, not reselling CortexDB. Condition (a) is satisfied **by
construction**: tenants reach memory only through the `MemoryProvider` seam, and
the credential and endpoint "never appear in logs, `/healthz`, `/spec`, status
output, or an export" (`storage.md`; `memory-engine.md` states the same rule in
its own words). A tenant cannot address the engine
directly.

Two obligations follow, and both of them are gates:

- **Never hand a tenant its own Cortex endpoint or credential.** Under
  instance-per-tenant that would be easy to do casually — a BYO-engine feature,
  or exposing the URL in a console — and it is precisely what (a) forbids. The
  seam's existing redaction already prevents it, so this is a **provisioning
  gate**: no surface that returns a tenant its own engine URL or key ships
  without re-reading clause 2. Phase 2 owns enforcing it.
- **Attribute CortexDB in product documentation** (clause 2b). A **release
  gate**, not a nicety: the attribution has to exist before the first tenant is
  served, not after someone remembers.

Clause 3 permits mirroring the binary on an internal artifact store for our own
use, which instance-per-tenant provisioning needs. Clause 5 points source access
and cloud-hosted offerings at sales@cortexdb.ai — neither is required here.

## Phased plan

**Phase 0 — decide.** Ratify instance-per-tenant, or accept the weak tier
explicitly and write down why. Licensing is settled (clause 2 permits it); what
remains is the topology decision, which gates everything below.

**Phase 1 — the driver. Done, and unbound.**
A `cortex` driver over `tinymemory-api` implementing the mandatory three —
`Core`, `Recall` and `Portability`. All three are non-negotiable:
`MemoryProvider` declares them as supertraits
(`MemoryCore + MemoryRecall + MemoryPortability`), so a driver missing
`export_page`/`import_records` does not compile, and
`advertised_capabilities()` returns the set unconditionally.

Only `Core` and `Recall` are exercised by the knowledge ports — that is the
whole of what `MemoryStore`, `ContextStore` and `FactStore` need, since all
three are host ports over the same `Bound` helper and no driver advertises or
withholds them individually. `Portability` is not optional scope to defer,
though: it is what Phase 3 runs migration over, and implementing it against an
append-only event log is its own problem rather than a line of glue. What Phase 1
leaves out is Cortex's derived fact and belief tier, which no host port reads and
which Phase 4 revisits.

Merged as [tinymemory#128](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/tinymemory/pull/128)
with a live-engine test lane, and registered here in #2065:
`SUPPORTED_REMOTE_DRIVERS`, `remote_provider()` and the console catalog all carry
`cortex`. Selecting it remains a decision this record argues against; the default
is untouched.

Acceptance, against the list this record set before the work started:

- the full driver conformance suite (tinymemory#18 §E1);
- failure-path tests for error mapping and malformed responses, as the existing
  remote adapters carry;
- **a bind refusal when the engine reports the mock embedding provider**;
- **a live reachability probe** for the mandatory families, with a freshly
  provisioned empty instance probing clean. Note this cannot be expressed
  through `provides()`, which is a fixed-body structural check — the lever is a
  probe or a conformance case (#1968, #1973);
- **key-exact deletion**, verified — and the `deleted.events: 2` alarm (see the
  [driver notes](memory-engine-cortex-driver.md)) was ours. Being precise about what was blocked and by whom, since only one of these
  is a guardrail:

  | Request | Enforced by | Result |
  |---|---|---|
  | `event_ids` (not a schema field) **+ `confirm_all: true`** | nothing | **the scope was wiped** — observed, not simulated |
  | `event_ids` alone | engine | `422 EMPTY_SELECTOR_WITHOUT_CONFIRMATION` |
  | `memory_ids` + `confirm_all: true` | engine | `400 AMBIGUOUS_SELECTOR_CONFIRM_ALL` |
  | `memory_ids` alone | — | exact: `requested: 1, matched: 1, deleted: 1` |

  An unrecognised selector field deserialises as an *empty* selector, meaning the
  whole scope. The engine refuses that on its own, but it cannot refuse it when
  `confirm_all` is also present, because that combination is a valid wipe request.
  So the only thing standing between a typo and a destroyed tenant is driver-side:
  it names `memory_ids` and never sends `confirm_all` anywhere.

Two operational notes. Select it with `OPENCOMPANY_MEMORY=remote` plus
`OPENCOMPANY_MEMORY_DRIVER=cortex` — `OPENCOMPANY_MEMORY=cortex` is still a hard
boot refusal as a **mode** value, left over from #1568. And registering the
driver needed no change to tinymemory's reserved table: `admit` takes an
unreserved id when the host declares the class, and this host declares every
remote driver `External` with `TRUSTED`, so the class stays host-decided rather
than self-reported.

**Phase 2 — provisioning. Shipped, except backup.** Per-tenant instance
lifecycle through opencompany-manager: create, inject `OPENCOMPANY_MEMORY_*`
alongside the existing `OPENCOMPANY_MONGODB_URI`/`_DB` injection, health-probe,
back up, destroy. Running on both runtimes — Kubernetes, and Firecracker on the
Hetzner host, where the engine lives *inside* the tenant's own microVM on
loopback rather than in a second VM.

Three things landed differently from how this section anticipated them.

**Sizing no longer waits.** Measured per engine: 120 MB steady and 152 MB peak
against a 100 MB corpus at `CORTEX_VECTOR_RESIDENT_MAX=20_000`.

`RESIDENT_MAX` caps resident vectors, it does not allocate them. Filled it would
hold `20_000 x 1536 x 4 bytes` = 123 MB — more than the whole engine measured,
which is the tell that a 100 MB corpus does not fill it. Memory scales with
*resident* vectors up to the cap and then stops: size a large corpus on the cap,
a small one on the measurement.

**A wake costs five times a boot.** Per-tenant cgroup peaks, one tenant, one
afternoon: cold boot (`--config-file`) 201.7 MB and 205.6 MB; wake from snapshot
(`PUT /snapshot/load`) 1.0 GB and 1.2 GB. A boot allocates only what the guest
touches; a restore faults in the whole saved address space, because that is what
a snapshot is. So ~200 MB is a floor seen once, on a first boot, and any fleet
that parks and wakes costs the ceiling. Restored pages are file-backed by
`vm.mem` and land in page cache, so the host reports them under `buff/cache`
rather than `used` and can reclaim the clean ones — survivable, not free.

**Two limits, governing different things.** RAM bounds how many tenants can be
awake at once. Size that on the **measured peak, not the guest ceiling**: the
1024 MiB ceiling caps what the guest can address, but the host-side cgroup peak
during a snapshot wake reached 1.2 GB, because the restore also charges the
VMM's own mapping of `vm.mem`. At that peak `(63.9 GB - ~1.8 GB host) / 1.2 GB`
is roughly **50**, and dividing by 1 GiB instead would recommend ~60 — enough to
overcommit the box precisely during a wave of wakes.

Disk bounds how many can exist: a parked tenant costs **~1.13 GB** — `vm.mem` is 1.1 GB and
genuinely not sparse, while `data.ext4` is 1.0 GB apparent but **30 MB
allocated** — so 828 GB of free space holds roughly **730**. A box therefore
carries ~730 companies of which ~50 can be awake simultaneously.

**Corrects an earlier revision of this section**, which said disk binds before
RAM and put a parked tenant at ~2 GB. That read apparent size and missed that
`data.ext4` is sparse; the two limits bound different quantities rather than one
preceding the other.

**The manager holds no provider credential at all.** This section assumed the
control plane would inject a fleet key. It does not: it asks the platform
backend for an `inference`-scoped key per instance
(`POST /opencompany/instances/{slug}/inference-key`), sending only the slug. The
backend resolves which team owns that instance, mints against it, and keeps the
provider credential server-side. What that replaced was an OpenRouter
*management* key held on the host — a credential able to create, re-limit and
delete every runtime key on the account, sitting on a machine whose whole job is
running other people's workloads. The per-tenant spend ceiling survived the move
as a monthly cap the backend applies, across both the `inference` and
`passthrough` buckets, since an engine calling the passthrough bills to the
latter.

**A prerequisite this section did not name:** the backend resolves the owning
team from an instance record, so a tenant created directly against the manager
has none and its mint answers 404. Under Firecracker a failed mint is fatal
rather than degrading, so tenants created outside the hosted flow must be
adopted before their first cold boot.

**Backup remains the open item.** There is still no backup path on the
Firecracker runtime; the logical export job exists elsewhere and nothing
schedules one here.

**Phase 3 — migration.** `opencompany memory migrate --to cortex` over the
Portability family. The generic procedure in
[`memory-engine.md`](memory-engine.md#switching-engines--the-operator-runbook)
holds; four things are specific to Cortex and one of them is a blocker.

**The target engine has to exist, and an existing company does not grow one by
waking.** `ensure_cortex` runs inside `provision`, and `ensure_running` calls
`provision` only when the workload object is *absent*. Parking keeps that
object, so a company created before Cortex was switched on never gets an engine
however many times it wakes. That is still true of the code.

What has changed is that the operator path behind it is now proven, so this is a
deliberate step rather than a blocker with nothing behind it. Discard the
tenant's snapshot — `vm.snap` and `vm.mem` under Firecracker, or delete the
StatefulSet under Kubernetes, whose PVC retention policy is `Retain` on both
delete and scale — and the next wake takes the boot path, which re-runs
provisioning and mints an engine. **The data disk is untouched: this is not
delete-and-recreate.** Six tenants were migrated this way with their memory
intact.

Provisioning learning to add an engine to a running tenant would still be
better, and is the remaining improvement here.

**The driver id is `cortex`, not `cortexdb`.** They are two adapters for the
same service and both are accepted targets; the manager injects `cortex`, so
that is what a migration onto a provisioned engine names. `cortexdb` sends
`X-Cortex-Actor` and this one does not.

**This does not use CortexDB's own export.** Migration reads through the
driver's Portability family — `namespace_summaries` then paged `get` — so it
moves host entries. `POST /v1/export` is a different, engine-native dump of
events plus derived records, and is what the backup path uses. Do not reach for
one expecting the other.

**Budget for the write cost.** Each record is an append plus a wait for
read-after-write visibility, and the adapter waits on both the scope listing and
ranked recall because they become ready seconds apart. That is per record, so a
migration's runtime is set by record count rather than bytes. Pause the company
first, as the generic runbook says, and expect the copy to dominate the outage.

The runbook's per-tenant-credential caution is satisfied by construction here:
instance-per-tenant means the source credential can only see one company's
records.

**Phase 4 — revisit the derived layers.** Previously gated on upstream defects
being fixed; per the [Correction](#correction-2026-09-04) it is now gated on
re-measuring them on a correctly configured server, since whether there is an
upstream defect at all is unproven. That is the point at which Cortex would
offer something the incumbent drivers do not.

## Open questions

- Does CortexDB agree with our reading of clause 2? Worth confirming in writing
  when we contact them, though the text is not ambiguous.
- What should a self-hosted multi-tenant deployment bind actors with? The
  cross-scope behaviour in finding 2 is *granted* by the deployment tier, so the
  open question is not whether it is a defect but how to narrow it: is
  `cortex-auth-ref` published, or is an external OIDC provider expected, against
  what contract, and will `PUT /v1/policy/{tier}` leave experimental? This
  decides whether a *shared* instance can ever reach the strong tier;
  instance-per-tenant reaches it without any of them.
- What is the true per-instance memory floor, from Cortex rather than the lint?
- Will the two filed defects be accepted? The release tracker is scoped to
  binary/packaging issues, with source bugs directed to Cortex Cloud support —
  so a self-hosted deployment's support path is itself unproven.
- Is there an undocumented prerequisite for fact extraction that we missed?
  **Yes — three.** See [Correction](#correction-2026-09-04).
- Will Cortex add an upsert path? **Answered enough to decide on.** No stateful
  key index is needed — append-and-fold works and passes. The question is no
  longer whether a driver is possible but whether its cost is worth paying: a
  scan per keyed read, seconds per write, and superseded values left in the
  ranking corpus.
- Is the embedded engine a fallback? `tinymemory-tinycortex` still exists and
  still passes the full suite, so it is technically viable today with no
  upstream dependency. #1568's PR body records only the mechanical removal and
  no rationale, so whether this is a real option or a closed door is unresolved.
- Self-hosted deployments have no support channel we can reach: the public
  tracker is packaging-only and Cortex Cloud support presumes a customer
  relationship. Worth settling when we contact them about the upsert gap.
- If Facts and Beliefs stay unreachable, does Cortex beat `supermemory` / `mem0`
  / `cognee` on retrieval alone? **No — but the premise is now unproven**
  ([Correction](#correction-2026-09-04)). Its ranked recall is vector search over
  the event log — confirmed on a fresh scope queried before any derived layer had
  built — which is what all three incumbents already provide through this seam,
  without a scan per read or a multi-second write.

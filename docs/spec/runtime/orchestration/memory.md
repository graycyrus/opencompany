# One memory contract

*Phase P0. Replacing three bespoke ports and a hand-rolled client with
`tinymemory`.*

Terms: [glossary](../../glossary.md). Supersedes the backend half of
[company-brain/memory.md](../../company-brain/memory.md); the operator rights in
that document are unchanged and become requirements on the decorator specified
here.

## The situation

OpenCompany independently built a thin version of the seam `tinymemory` exists
to provide. `src/store/tinycortex.rs` (removed in #1568) defined a bespoke
`CortexClient` trait with `CortexMemoryStore: MemoryStore` and
`CortexContextStore: ContextStore` over it, alongside an in-process engine
implementation.

Meanwhile `tinymemory` is already vendored — transitively, as a submodule of
`vendor/openhuman` — and OpenHuman already binds it properly across hundreds of
call sites. We are maintaining a second, weaker integration of the same engine.

`tinymemory` is not an engine. It is an engine-neutral **contract**, a driver
registry, and a set of adapters: `MemoryProvider`, with three mandatory
capability families and ten optional ones, negotiated once at bind time. The
default engine is embedded and makes no network call; remote adapters exist for
several hosted services.

## What changes

**Replace `CortexClient` with `dyn MemoryProvider`.** Keep `MemoryStore`,
`ContextStore` and `FactStore` as **typed facades** over one provider rather
than as three independent storage backends.

The ports stay because their types are the company's vocabulary. The backends
collapse because there is no reason to have three.

| Port | Maps to | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FactStore` | `MemoryCore` store / get / forget / list | near-exact fit; `forget` already returns a bool. Upgrades a substring scan to ranked retrieval |
| `ContextStore` | `MemoryCore` + `MemoryRecall` | `put` → store keyed by content address; `search` → recall. **Gap:** ranged `peek` becomes a host-side slice after a full read |
| `MemoryStore` | `MemoryCore` in a traces namespace | **Gap:** `evict` — see below |

### Sequence

`FactStore` first: the best fit and the weakest current implementation.
`ContextStore` second, accepting whole-entry reads. `MemoryStore` last, or not
at all — append-only, eviction-driven trace rows are the shape the contract
suits least, and there is no obligation to move them.

## The decorator is not optional

`tinymemory` deliberately owns no policy. Tier enforcement, scope predicates,
taint stamping, redaction, egress checks and audit belong to the host, on the
path every caller takes — because a driver that could be swapped for one that
skips enforcement is the entire reason a policy layer exists.

For OpenCompany that is a hard requirement, and here is why.

> **The three ports take `&CompanyId` as an explicit first argument. That is a
> compiler-enforced tenant-isolation invariant.** `tinymemory` has only a
> `namespace: &str`. A missing prefix is a silent cross-tenant leak with no
> type-level guard.

So the decorator MUST be the **only** public constructor for a company's memory
handle, and it MUST derive the namespace from the `CompanyId` itself. Code that
can name a raw namespace string must not exist outside it. The existing
requirement stands unchanged: company A's facts MUST be invisible to company B.

The decorator additionally owns:

- **Per-agent and per-desk scoping.** Both cognition ports key on `CompanyId`
  alone today, so there is no partition below the company and no
  shared-versus-private distinction. The
  [alignment layer](alignment.md) needs one.
- **The scratch firewall.** Provisional working-out MUST be unreachable from
  durable recall **by construction**, not by routing. The sibling runtime
  enforces this by excluding the scratch dataset from the recall path entirely;
  the roles that judge get neither half of it, because unsettled working-out
  read as progress is what keeps a loop retrying.
- **Archive on evict.** Our `evict` *archives rather than destroys*, and a test
  asserts it. `tinymemory` has no archive tier and no bulk delete by predicate,
  so this behaviour moves into the decorator. It MUST NOT be quietly downgraded
  to deletion.
- **Taint.** Every inbound-channel write MUST be stamped external-trust. None of
  the three ports model provenance today, and a company that reads the web needs
  it. Laundering external content into internal-trust content is the failure
  this exists to prevent.

  One correction to an earlier reading of the contract, since it changes what
  the rule actually is. The taint-dropping default is `Memory::store_with_taint`
  on the **engine-side storage trait** (`api/src/traits.rs`), not on the
  provider contract. `MemoryCore::store` on `MemoryProvider` takes `MemoryTaint`
  as a mandatory parameter with no default at all, and the contract says why:
  "a driver that could default it would be able to launder externally-sourced
  content into internal-trust content."

  So the duty is not "override a taint-dropping default" — there is nothing to
  override. It is **never wrap a bare `Memory`; always wrap a
  `MemoryProvider`**. Reaching for the storage trait is the mistake to guard
  against, because that is where the silent default lives.
- **Operator rights.** Inspect, delete, redact and export from
  [company-brain/memory.md](../../company-brain/memory.md) are decorator
  responsibilities. Export is already mandatory in the contract, which helps: a
  user who cannot export cannot leave.

## Version pinning

Build against the **vendored** copy under `vendor/openhuman/vendor/tinymemory`,
which is the copy OpenHuman itself pins. A standalone checkout may be on an
older contract major, and compatibility is rejected across that gap — binding
the wrong copy yields two incompatible versions of the same trait in one
process.

**`tinymemory` and `tinycortex` are not two names for one thing.** This was
resolved while landing the phase, and the distinction is load-bearing:

| Path | Crate | `CONTRACT_VERSION` | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vendor/openhuman/vendor/tinymemory/crates/tinymemory-api` | `tinymemory-api` | `(3, 0)` | The contract. **Bind this.** |
| `vendor/openhuman/vendor/tinycortex/api` | `tinycortex-api` | `(3, 0)`, re-exported | Deprecated re-export of the above |
| `vendor/openhuman/vendor/tinycortex` | `tinycortex` | — | The engine OpenHuman pins (removed as an OpenCompany memory backend in #1568) |

The two crates no longer disagree on a version: `tinycortex-api` re-exports
`CONTRACT_VERSION` straight from `tinymemory_api`, so `is_compatible` —
major-equality only — now answers *compatible* for the pair. The separation
therefore rests entirely on crate identity: they are separate crates, so their
`MemoryProvider` traits are distinct types no matter what the version says.
Binding the wrong one is a type error rather than a version refusal, which is
the stronger guarantee but a quieter one, so do not read a version check as
enforcing it. OpenHuman has additionally
inlined the v2 contract into its own tree at
`vendor/openhuman/src/openhuman/memory/api/`, and that inlined copy is what its
live binding uses; its module docs call `tinycortex-api` "now a deprecated
re-export of this one" and treat the string `tinycortex` as a legacy driver-id
alias.

So the engine keeps its name and stays pinned by path for OpenHuman's own
build; only the *contract* moved. `Cargo.toml` path-deps `tinymemory-api` at
the same directory `vendor/openhuman/Cargo.toml` names, because Cargo unifies
two path deps only when they resolve to the same directory.

The registry, the HTTP adapters for hosted engines, and the vendor adapter all
already exist in `vendor/openhuman/vendor/tinymemory` — they were never in
`tinycortex`, whose contract crate excludes `Driver`, `DriverClass`,
`SubsystemRegistry` and the policy `Guard` on purpose.

Engine adapters name their engines by version requirement rather than by path,
specifically so a host that already pins its own engine checkout unifies onto
one copy. Ours does. Keep it that way.

## Cost

`tinymemory-core` brings a bundled SQLite and a substantial subsystem. The
current direct dependency is documented as adding no new compilation to an
`openhuman` build, so this is a real increase, and there are two ways to avoid
paying it: bind only the contract crate plus an adapter, or take the loadable
module route, which keeps the engine out of the host's compile graph entirely.

Decide this before P0 lands, not after.

## What we gain beyond parity

- **One seam.** Three ad-hoc ports plus a bespoke client become one driver
  contract, with the engine chosen by configuration.
- **Ranked hybrid retrieval** with an explainable score breakdown, replacing a
  degraded lexical-and-recency path. [Demand
  dedup](demand-ledger.md#identity-and-dedup) depends on this — it is what
  turns a lexical hash into a semantic check.
- **Portability for free**, rather than hand-rolled per store.
- **A goal anchor.** OpenCompany has no goals entity at all — no store, no
  manifest section. The contract has a goals family, and it is deliberately thin
  (an ordered list of id-and-text). That is the right weight: the goal is an
  anchor the roles share, and the [demand ledger](demand-ledger.md) is the work
  model.
- **A summary tree.** The contract ships levelled summaries with drill-down,
  sealing and cascade. This is worth noting because the sibling runtime
  *documents* such a tree and never implemented it — the modules its own
  architecture doc names do not exist. Bind the one that does rather than
  rebuilding the one that does not.

## What we must not lose

- **Typed records.** The port types become encoded content on the way in. Where
  structure matters, use the documents family rather than flattening to a
  string — but note the default engine adapter may not advertise it, in which
  case the facade owns the encoding and its round-trip test.
- **The isolation invariant.** Covered above; it is the single largest risk in
  this phase.
- **Archive-not-destroy** and the ranged read. Both are host-side now.

---

## Verification

- A cross-company namespace leak is unrepresentable: the decorator is the only
  constructor, and no call site can name a raw namespace.
- The existing eviction test still passes — `evict` archives, and does not
  destroy.
- Taint survives an export and re-import, and the wrapped driver overrides the
  taint-dropping default.
- Scratch content is unreachable from durable recall, asserted against the
  recall path rather than against a routing table.
- Judging roles hold neither half of the scratch.
- Capability advertisement matches reachable accessors for every bound driver.
- Every facade round-trips its typed record through the provider without loss.
- The conformance suite still holds fs, sqlite and mongodb to identical answers
  for any port that keeps a non-provider backend.

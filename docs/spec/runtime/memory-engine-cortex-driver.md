# Writing a driver against CortexDB v0.9.8

Companion to [`memory-engine-cortex.md`](memory-engine-cortex.md), which asks
whether we should host Cortex at all. This one assumes that question is still
open and answers a narrower one: what a `MemoryProvider` driver has to do to
speak to CortexDB v0.9.8, and what that costs at every call.

Split out of the design record when it outgrew the 500-line cap. The record kept
the decision; this kept the mechanics behind it.

The driver these notes describe is merged as
[tinymemory#128](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/tinymemory/pull/128) and is
deliberately unregistered — see the record's phased plan.

## The upsert gap, and what it costs to work around

This is the finding that decides the phasing, and it is not about capability
breadth — it is that the two data models disagree.

`Memory::store` is an **idempotent upsert keyed by `(namespace, key)`**: storing
twice at one key replaces the previous content "rather than erroring or creating
a duplicate". The conformance suite asserts it directly
(`assert_upsert_replaces_rather_than_duplicates`) — write `first`, write
`second`, expect one row holding `second`. `memory-engine.md` makes that suite
the thing that retired the unproven-remote flag, so passing it is not optional.

CortexDB is an append-only event log. Measured against the deployment:

| Attempt | Result |
|---|---|
| Same key, different content | `409 IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` — "idempotency key reused with a different body" |
| Same key, identical content | `202`, `replayed_from_idempotency: true` |
| Update route | none — `/v1/events` and `/v1/events/{id}` are GET-only, `/v1/experience` POST-only |
| Forget, then rewrite the key | forget succeeds, rewrite still `409` — **and the scope is left holding nothing** |
| Carry our own key in the envelope | `422` — closed schema, and `/v1/events` has no metadata filter regardless |

The idempotency ledger is independent of the event store and survives
`/v1/forget`, so delete-then-rewrite loses the original *and* refuses the
replacement. It is strictly worse than not attempting it.

**The engine can already do this; the HTTP surface cannot express it.** The
embedded adapter that #1568 removed (`tinymemory-tinycortex`) forwards `store`
straight through to the engine's own implementation, and that crate runs the
*full* conformance suite over `TinycortexProvider`
(`tests/full_provider_conformance.rs`) — including
`assert_upsert_replaces_rather_than_duplicates`. The engine core therefore
passes the exact assertion the hosted API fails.

That makes the upstream ask narrow and concrete: expose over HTTP what the
engine already implements and is already conformance-tested against, rather than
add a capability. It also suggests the gap is an API-surface oversight rather
than a deliberate design position.

Two emulations exist, and neither is comfortable. A driver can keep an
**external index** of `(namespace, key) → event_id`, writing with fresh
idempotency keys and forgetting the prior event on overwrite — which makes the
driver stateful, carrying a database of its own. Or it can put the key in an
**in-content envelope** and resolve it with a client-side scan; the host already
wraps records in a JSON envelope inside `content` (`Bound::put` calls
`encode(record)`), so that is the shape it uses anyway — but a scan-per-read is
slow and still non-atomic.

Only the first rests on `forget`, and that matters, because `forget` is where our
worst scare came from: a call reporting `deleted.events: 2` for a selector naming
one event id. That turned out to be our own malformed request rather than an
engine defect — the record's Phase 1 acceptance notes set out exactly which layer
refuses what — but an emulation that deletes the previous event on every
overwrite puts that call on the write path of every store, which is a lot of
blast radius to accept for something an upstream `on_conflict: replace` would
remove entirely.

The envelope-and-fold path does not delete anything. It appends the new event and
lets the fold prefer the newest per key, so the previous version stays on disk and
is simply not returned. That is the path the shipped driver takes, and it is why
its `forget` is confined to `delete`, where a caller asked for removal.

The reproduction is recorded at
[cortexdb-releases#3](https://github.com/cortexdbai/cortexdb-releases/issues/3)
— closed there, like #1 and #2, because that tracker is scoped to packaging, and
being raised with CortexDB directly instead.

**This was written as blocking Phase 1. It is not.** The driver appends every
write under a fresh idempotency key — which the engine always accepts — carrying
the logical key inside the payload, and folds to newest-per-key on read.
Replacement is reconstructed on the read side rather than performed on the write
side, and the conformance suite passes that way against a live v0.9.8.

The price is paid on every call, and it is the real input to the decision:

- **keyed reads are a scan.** `/v1/events` has no metadata filter, so `get` and
  `list` fetch the scope and fold it — a walk growing with everything the
  namespace has held.
- **writes cost seconds, not milliseconds.** `/v1/experience` answers
  `202 captured` and indexes after, so the driver waits for its own record to be
  readable: 1–4s to the listing, a second more to ranked recall.
- **superseded values reach `recall`, and this one is not merely a cost.** The
  fold removes them from keyed reads and cannot remove them from recall — the one
  path Cortex was wanted for. A caller can be handed a value `get` would never
  return. Whether that breaks the contract or is permitted backend-defined
  behaviour is unsettled, and **the conformance suite does not decide it**:
  `assert_upsert_replaces_rather_than_duplicates` reads back through `list` and
  never calls `recall`, so passing it says nothing about this axis. Treat the
  green suite as coverage that stops short here, not as proof.

None of the three is a defect in the driver; each is the cost of emulating
replacement on an engine that does not offer it. But **an upsert alone would only
remove the third.** `on_conflict: "replace"` is our proposed ask, not a documented
CortexDB option, and even if it shipped: keyed reads still scan, because that
needs a metadata filter on `/v1/events`; writes still wait, because that needs a
readiness signal the engine does not expose. Three asks, not one.

## What building it taught us

Five engine behaviours surfaced only against a running instance, and each one
produced a driver that passed every offline test and was wrong in production —
the conformance double and the driver were written from the same documentation,
so they agreed with each other rather than with the service. The catalogue lives
in `cortex.rs`'s module docs, beside the code that has to cope with each one,
which is where it stays current.

The generalisable part belongs here: **a double written from a vendor's
documentation cannot tell you the vendor's documentation is wrong.** The lane
that found these runs the same conformance suite against a live engine
(`tests/live_remote_engines.rs`), and it is worth pointing at every hosted engine
we bind, not just this one — which is the argument #1968 was opened to settle.

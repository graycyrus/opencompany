# Policy Module

The policy module owns the default `ApprovalGate` and durable approval queue.
Policy-generated HITL is currently disabled: production evaluation allows
effects that the historical taxonomy would park, while `readonly` and the
emergency stop remain hard denials.

Approval cards come from explicit `park_effect` calls, including the intrinsic
`request_approval` tool and specialized tools that openly stage a concrete
approval. Ordinary tool calls are not silently converted into prompts.

## The operator overlay and the live gate

The gate is built from the seed manifest's `[policy]` alone, then reconciled
with the operator's console override once the persisted record is read.
`CompanyRecord::effective_policy` resolves the merge (per field, `None` meaning
"not overridden"), and the runtime applies it to the live gate with
`ManifestApprovalGate::apply_effective_policy` at boot/rebuild and at the start
of every cycle (issue #1455). The swap keeps the parked queue and the emergency
switch; only the evaluation snapshot and the derived deadline move.

The two halves move on different timings. The deadline (`[policy].approval_ttl_hours`)
is **immediate**: a policy `PUT`/`DELETE` calls `ManifestApprovalGate::apply_effective_ttl`
right after the write persists, because a parked card's deadline is re-evaluated
against the current TTL each time it is displayed, swept or resolved — waiting
for the next cycle would let approvals parked under a longer TTL outlive the
deadline the console just reported. The evaluation snapshot (mode,
`always_approve`, spend cap) moves at the next safe turn boundary instead: an
in-flight turn must finish under the policy snapshot it started with, and a
failed rebuild must not leave the still-live runtime enforcing a policy its
record does not describe. A test-injected gate is exempt — it carries its own
policy/TTL on purpose.

There are two ways onto that queue, both landing in `CycleHostImpl::park` (so a
parked effect is journaled one way and survives a restart with its original id):

- `CycleHost::emit_effect` still evaluates an effect, but production policy no
  longer returns `RequireApproval`.
- `CycleHost::park_effect` — an effect whose verdict the brain **already**
  reached, parked as-is. This is the harness brain's path: its openhuman
  `ApprovalPolicy` blocks a gated tool call inside the agent turn, and the
  projected call is then held for the operator rather than re-decided (issue
  #172). Re-evaluating it here would `Allow` — and so silently "execute" as a
  no-op — anything in the `Other` group, which is most gated tool calls. See
  [the OpenHuman module](../openhuman/README.md#approval-parking).

The historical checkpoint classification remains for audit and future policy
modes, but no longer creates HITL. Explicitly parked approvals
**default-deny on silence**: they expire to `deny` after a configurable window
(`[policy].approval_ttl_hours`, default 24 hours) measured against an
injectable clock. The window is enforced at resolution time by the gate itself;
draining the queue is the `MaintenanceTicker`'s job (issue #971). The operator may **edit**
a parked effect's payload and approve the amended version; the follow-up cycle
shows the brain both the original and the edit.

## What still stops a call

"Policy-generated HITL is disabled" is easy to read as "nothing gates
anything", which is wrong and leads to the wrong fix. The arms below still
decide, in this order, and all of them sit **above** the
`policy_hitl_enabled` bypass in `ApprovalPolicy::check`:

| Arm | Answer |
|---|---|
| Explicit `request_approval` | `Allow` — asking is not itself an effect to decide |
| Emergency stop | `Deny` for every effect outside `EffectGroup::Other` |
| Web deflection | `Deny` for a raw web call at a connected Composio provider's host |
| `readonly` brake | `Deny` for anything that mutates or reaches outside |
| Single-use grant | `Allow` — the operator approved exactly this call |
| Standing deny / standing grant | Refuse or admit, per the operator's period decision |
| Paid media | `RequireApproval` — these tools stage their own card |

`request_approval` is first, and its answer is `Allow` rather than
`RequireApproval`, because the call being judged *is* the question: `check`
returns `Allow` and `RequestApprovalTool::execute` then queues the card itself.
A second ask inside one turn is refused by the boundary above this row, so the
early `Allow` cannot be used to spin cards. Reading it as `RequireApproval`
suggests policy stages the card, which is the wrong place to look when an
approval surface misbehaves.

The emergency-stop row is enforced directly inside `ApprovalPolicy::check`
itself, not delegated to the gate: a harness tool call never reaches
`ManifestApprovalGate::evaluate`/`park`, so `check` re-reads the same
`AtomicBool` (via `emergency_gate`) before it can return any of the `Allow`s
below it. `evaluate`/`park` enforce the identical veto on their own path — an
effect that does reach the durable approval queue — so the effect gate and the
harness call policy agree independently rather than one delegating to the
other; see [Emergency stop](#emergency-stop) below for that path.

Below the bypass sit the tier dispatch, `always_approve`, the daily cap and
`crate::policy::judge`. Those are the arms #1925 turned off: an arm added there
today compiles, tests green, and never runs in production. Enforcement has to
go above the bypass, and the paid-media arms are the precedent for how.

The console reads this state rather than assuming it — the policy DTO carries
`policyHitlEnabled` off the live gate, so the always-ask list is not presented
as an active gate while it creates no approvals (issue #2149).

## The consequence floor, and its shadow measurement

`crate::policy::floor` owns the consequence rule: which calls commit the
company — a declared irreversible `EffectGroup` whose reach is
`Reach::Consequence`, or a call carrying money at or above the cap in force.
It has two readers and one implementation, because a single approval rule read
from two places has already drifted into two answers once (issue #684).

The first reader is `judge`, which passes no cap. The second is a **shadow**
reader immediately above the `policy_hitl_enabled` bypass: it records what a
floor would have stopped and changes no decision (issue #2147). Epic #1817 asks
for that stop to be enforced; whether it should be is a product question, and
the input to it is how often such a stop would fire on live traffic — a
taxonomically narrow floor can still be practically wide, and a floor that
parks constantly becomes a stream of TTL default-denials rather than oversight.

The floor deliberately excludes `judge`'s other two arms, which stop on
*mechanism* — an undeclared tool, or one whose reach cannot be bounded, so
`shell` stops even for `ls`. That is the interruption #1925 removed.
`the_floor_is_silent_on_mechanism_alone` pins the distinction so it is
executable rather than argued.

`publish_artifact` stays deferred per the #658 ruling and is counted on its own
axis, so that ruling can be revisited with a number instead of two opinions.

Measurement output goes to the `policy::shadow_floor` tracing target, named
explicitly in `DEFAULT_LOG_FILTER` — the binary's default filter is a bare
`error` and nothing sets `RUST_LOG` in a tenant, so an unnamed target would
record nothing and the empty result would read as a finding. To aggregate a
window of it:

```sh
kubectl logs -n <ns> <tenant-pod> --since=168h | scripts/aggregate-shadow-floor.sh
```

## Emergency stop

`ManifestApprovalGate` carries an `AtomicBool` kill switch, checked by
`evaluate` **before** every policy rule including `always_approve`. While it is
engaged, any effect outside `EffectGroup::Other` is `Deny` — not
`RequireApproval`, so the approval queue cannot be used to work around the
switch. The `Other` exemption no longer means chat keeps working: admission
itself is gated one layer up, in `CompanyRuntime::ensure_not_emergency_stopped`
(checked at every cycle entry point, including chat), so nothing reaches this
gate to take the exemption while the stop is engaged. It stays in place so
release restores evaluation to its exact pre-stop shape.

The durable state is the event log, not a record field: `replayed_emergency`
scans for the last `CompanyEvent::EmergencyPauseChanged` at boot and
`CompanyRuntime::hydrate_emergency` seeds the flag from it, **failing safe to
stopped** if the log cannot be read. The switch is untouched by `sweep_expired`
— it has no TTL and never auto-releases.

Full normative rules, including the asymmetric confirmation on the two REST
routes, are in
[`docs/spec/company-brain/approvals.md`](../../spec/company-brain/approvals.md#emergency-stop-the-governance-kill-switch).

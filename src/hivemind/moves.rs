//! The per-member move grammar: which trace kinds a seat may open a line with.
//!
//! A room whose members may all make every move is a room that votes. The live
//! evidence is unambiguous: on a nine-episode run of `companies/hive_math_lab`
//! every episode was three independent `!propose`s of the same number followed
//! by a `!commit`, and quorum carried because in `tinyhivemind` a `!propose`
//! counts as its own author's support. No `!support`, `!object`, `!evidence`,
//! `!question` or `!pin` was ever deposited. Three agents agreeing in parallel
//! is not deliberation; it is three answers with a quorum rule stapled on.
//!
//! The repair is structural rather than exhortative. A desk assigns moves —
//! one proposer, one challenger who may only object or refute, an archivist who
//! may only supply evidence — and the driver **enforces** the assignment, so a
//! member that cannot propose has to do something with the floor other than
//! restate the answer.
//!
//! What the table gates is the *deliberation* kinds only. `commit`, `question`
//! and `defer` ([`UNGATED_KINDS`]) belong to every seat however narrow its
//! entry: recording a topic the room has already carried re-derives nothing,
//! and a member with nothing to add must always have something to say that is
//! not prose. See [`UNGATED_KINDS`] for the live run that made this a rule.
//!
//! Enforcement is deliberately two-stage and never fatal: a first violation is
//! a one-line correction and a second attempt, and a second violation is
//! journaled with its leading `!` removed. A demoted line still says whatever
//! the member wanted to say — it simply deposits no trace, because
//! `tinyhivemind_hive::trace::resolve` only reads a marker at the start of a
//! line. It can therefore never be folded as support for anything, which is the
//! one outcome that would let a barred move still carry a topic.

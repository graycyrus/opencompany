//! Which journal rows one running episode may fold as its own.
//!
//! `EpisodeState::watermark` (in `tinyhivemind_hive`) is a **lower** bound
//! only: everything at or below it is context, and everything above it folds
//! as this episode's traces. That is exactly right for the one episode a desk
//! usually has running, and exactly wrong the moment a second one opens in the
//! same conversation — a follow-up accepted before the first episode's turns
//! finish shares its `(desk_id, thread_root)` with the first, so the second
//! episode's watermark check sees the first episode's turns sitting above its
//! own trigger and folds them as its own live traces. A desk can converge on
//! the answer to a question nobody in that episode ever asked.
//!
//! `tinyhivemind_hive` cannot fix this itself: `step` folds a transcript slice
//! the host already narrowed, and has no idea two hosts are narrowing the same
//! journal at once. The narrowing has to happen here, before the transcript
//! ever reaches the fold. [`EpisodeScope`] is that narrowing: an upper
//! boundary companion to the watermark, scoped to one [`EpisodeDriver`]
//! instance for the lifetime of one `run` call.
//!
//! A row is admitted by a scope when it is at or below the trigger (shared,
//! readable context — unchanged from before this existed) **or** when this
//! specific episode instance is the one that appended it. The second half is
//! knowable without a second journal read: every row this episode ever writes
//! goes through [`EpisodeScope::record`] at the point it is appended, whether
//! that append is a turn, a failed-turn note, the closing report, or an answer
//! a referral carried back onto this desk. Nothing about a *concurrent*
//! episode's own turns can ever appear in this set, because they are recorded
//! against a different `EpisodeScope` instance entirely.
//!

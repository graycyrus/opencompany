//! Issue #1776 — drafting **one** teammate's mandate or persona, for an
//! operator who then keeps it or throws it away.
//!
//! A teammate's `description` (the mandate: one line on what it owns) and
//! `instructions` (the persona appended to its system prompt) are the two
//! fields that decide how it behaves, and the two an operator has the least
//! help writing. This module holds the shape of a draft; the model call that
//! produces one lives in [`crate::harness::profile_draft`], behind the
//! `openhuman` feature.
//!
//! ## Why this is not the roster designer's rule being relaxed
//!
//! [`crate::company::setup`] deliberately keeps the model out of a teammate's
//! standing instructions: it names a work *shape* from a closed enum and the
//! host owns every word. That rule is untouched, and it must stay that way —
//! it governs teammates that are **created** from a design pass, where the text
//! reaches a system prompt with nobody having read it, through a route any
//! member can call.
//!
//! A draft is the opposite case in the one way that matters. It is returned to
//! the operator and stored by **nothing**: the route that produces it never
//! writes, the console shows it beside the field rather than in it, and the
//! text only becomes a persona if a person takes it and then saves. That is the
//! same stance the workflow copilot's proposal protocol takes — the model's
//! output is data in a reply, and the operator's own action is what writes.
//!
//! So the boundary this module holds is narrow and specific: **a draft is
//! bounded like the field it is for, and it is never applied here.**

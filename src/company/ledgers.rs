//! The one place a ledger is read, written, declared or retired.
//!
//! Every surface — the REST routes, the agent tools, the console — comes
//! through here rather than reaching the [`LedgerStore`] directly, and that is
//! load-bearing rather than tidy. Four rules only hold if exactly one code path
//! enforces them:
//!
//! * **Only a person deletes.** [`delete_entry`] and [`retire`] check
//!   [`AuthorKind::may_delete`] on the caller, so an agent cannot reach a
//!   deletion by finding a route that forgot to.
//! * **A writer must be allowed to write.** [`LedgerSpec::writers`] is checked
//!   at call time, because the set of ledgers is not fixed when tools are
//!   wired — a company may declare one afterwards, so holding `record_entry` is
//!   not permission to write everything.
//! * **A close says why.** A closing status that declares `needs_reason` and is
//!   written with no reason is refused at the write rather than reported at the
//!   read, because a row that closed silently is worth nothing to whoever picks
//!   it up next and by then the person who knew has moved on.
//! * **A required field is required at the write.** A ledger that declares the
//!   `required-field` check refuses a row that would land without one, for the
//!   same reason: the reader already calls such a row unreadable, so accepting
//!   it stores something every surface then reports as a fault — the row
//!   rendered twice, once as itself and once under *rows that could not be
//!   read*. The check runs against the merged row, so amending one that already
//!   carries the field is not refused for declining to repeat it.
//! * **The derived file follows the write.** Every mutation re-renders and
//!   republishes, so `derived/` is never a stale copy of something.
//! * **A write and a purge on the same ledger never interleave.** Checking a
//!   required field or a close reason reads the stored row first and only
//!   then appends; a purge landing in that gap would remove the very events
//!   the check just relied on, so the append that follows would recreate the
//!   row without them and still report success. [`record`], [`delete_entry`]
//!   and [`retire`] all take [`ledger_lock`] for one company's one ledger
//!   before touching the store, so the two paths queue behind each other
//!   instead of racing.

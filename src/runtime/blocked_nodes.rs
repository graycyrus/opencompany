//! One blocked agent node, one continuation (issue #899, Stage 1).
//!
//! # What this stashes, and why the [`ContinuationQueue`] cannot
//!
//! A policy-gated call inside an agent node's own tool loop parks a
//! tool-call-shaped effect (`agent: Some`). Approving it mints a grant, but
//! nothing re-dispatches the workflow run — the hole issue #899 closes. The fix
//! reuses the [`ContinuationQueue`](crate::runtime::continuation::ContinuationQueue)
//! to count a node's parked calls as one batch (armed at park time under a
//! [`workflow_node_turn_key`](crate::runtime::workflow_resume::workflow_node_turn_key)),
//! and releases once when the last decision lands. But to *spawn* the
//! continuation the host needs two facts that batch cannot carry — the
//! **workflow id** and the paused run's **trigger input** — for the same reason
//! [`WorkflowGateQueue`](crate::runtime::workflow_gates::WorkflowGateQueue)
//! exists beside that queue for gates: the released batch is only
//! `ApprovalResolved` events, and the parked tool-call effect carries no
//! workflow lineage of its own (it is minted by `ApprovalPolicy::effect_for`,
//! which knows nothing of the run).
//!
//! # Why armed at block-settle, not at park time
//!
//! The calls are parked mid-turn from `HarnessAgentRunner`, which does **not**
//! carry the trigger input (only the run request). The runner's block-settle
//! *does* — it is the one place with the workflow id and the trigger input
//! beside the list of blocked nodes — so the stash is populated there, exactly
//! as `park_pending_gates` populates the gate queue from the runner.
//!
//! # Durability, stated plainly
//!
//! In-memory, and — unlike [`WorkflowGateQueue`] — **not** rehydrated from the
//! journal at recovery, because the parked tool-call effect carries no
//! workflow id or trigger input to rebuild it from (widening the effect payload
//! to carry them is a larger change than Stage 1 takes on). A restart in the
//! middle of a blocked node therefore comes back with the
//! [`ContinuationQueue`] counter re-armed (from `parked_turns`) but the stash
//! empty: the batch releases and finds nothing to spawn, and the operator is
//! told to re-run the workflow. That is a strictly worse restart story than the
//! gate path's, and it is the Stage-1 boundary — the durable-card version is
//! Stage 2 territory.

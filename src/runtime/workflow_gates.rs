//! One workflow run, one continuation (issue #978).
//!
//! # The amplification this closes
//!
//! A run that fans out to N gated nodes parks N cards. Before this, approving
//! one of them re-dispatched the **whole run** on the spot — the spawn lived in
//! `perform_effect`, which fires once per approved effect — and the replay
//! carried an `approvals` array naming only that one node, so the other N-1
//! paused again and parked again. Three approvals produced three runs and six
//! new cards; the reported staging tenant went 3 → 6 → 12 → 24 and accumulated
//! 77 runs of one disabled workflow.
//!
//! [`ContinuationQueue`](crate::runtime::continuation::ContinuationQueue) already
//! solves the shape of this problem for an agent turn: count the outstanding
//! decisions, release once when the last lands. Issue #978 makes a workflow run
//! a turn in exactly that sense, keyed by
//! [`workflow_turn_key`](crate::runtime::workflow_resume::workflow_turn_key).
//! This module is the half that queue cannot supply.
//!
//! # Why a second structure, and not a field on the batch
//!
//! `ContinuationQueue::decide` hands back `ApprovalResolved` events: an id, a
//! verdict, an actor. To re-dispatch a run the host needs two things that are
//! not in there — **which graph node** each id was gating, and the paused run's
//! **trigger input** with its delivery / outward-call ledgers.
//!
//! Neither is recoverable from the journal at release time, and that is not an
//! oversight to route around. `RuntimeJournal` drops the parked entry on resolve
//! (`parked.remove`), and the record it *does* retain past resolution —
//! `approval_effects` — is deliberately **payload-scrubbed** (issue #351), so a
//! resolved gate's id, input and ledgers are all gone by construction. Widening
//! that scrub to keep them would reopen a privacy rule for the benefit of one
//! caller.
//!
//! So the facts are stashed here instead, at **park** time, from the one place
//! gates are parked.
//!
//! # Why park time, and not approve time
//!
//! Because **deny** never reaches the approve path. A denied effect resolves to
//! [`ResolveOutcome`](crate::policy::ResolveOutcome)`::Denied` and never touches
//! `perform_effect`, so a stash populated when an approval is *performed* would
//! hold no node id for a refusal — and the continuation, not knowing the node
//! was refused, would replay into it, pause, and park a fresh card. An approval
//! round that cleared three and created one is the same defect in miniature.
//!
//! Arming at park time covers approve, deny and TTL expiry with one mechanism,
//! which is what makes the denial ledger
//! ([`PAYLOAD_DENIED`](crate::runtime::workflow_resume::PAYLOAD_DENIED))
//! expressible at all.
//!
//! # One representative effect per run, not one per gate
//!
//! Every gate of a single run is built by one `park_pending_gates` loop from one
//! `trigger_input`, one run-level `deliveries` slice and one run-level
//! `performed` slice, and `gate_effect` derives the two ledgers purely from
//! those. So `input` / `delivered` / `performed` are byte-identical across
//! siblings **by construction** — including the case where an earlier node
//! already delivered before the fan-out, because that delivery is in the
//! run-level list every sibling is handed, not in a per-branch subset. Only
//! `node_id`, the call description and the per-gate upstream `content` vary, and
//! a continuation needs none of those. Keeping one effect per run rather than
//! one per gate is what stops this from holding N copies of a trigger input.
//!
//! # Durability, stated plainly
//!
//! In-memory, on exactly [`ContinuationQueue`]'s terms, and rehydrated at
//! recovery from the journal's still-parked gates
//! ([`rearm`](WorkflowGateQueue::rearm)) the way that queue is rehydrated from
//! `parked_turns`. The limit is inherited rather than added: a restart in the
//! middle of a partly-decided run comes back knowing only the gates still
//! parked, so a batch released after it carries the last decision and not the
//! ones banked before it. Those un-carried siblings re-park. That is pre-#469
//! behaviour for agent turns; #978 is where a workflow run starts feeling it.

//! Issue #383: the live set of workflow runs an operator can still stop.
//!
//! A run used to be reachable only as an in-flight HTTP request. Nothing held a
//! handle to it, so there was nowhere to send "stop" — which is why the issue is
//! *both* halves at once: a run has to be addressable while it is running before
//! it can be cancellable at all.
//!
//! [`RunSupervisor`] is that address book. [`begin`](RunSupervisor::begin) mints
//! the run's [`WorkflowRunContext`] — the same context, carrying the same
//! `run_id` issue #371 already correlates progress events on, so **no second
//! identifier is introduced** — and registers its [`RunCancel`] handle;
//! [`cancel`](RunSupervisor::cancel) fires that handle;
//! [`RunGuard`]'s `Drop` deregisters the entry on every exit path.
//!
//! ## What it holds, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! It holds **cancel handles, not [`JoinHandle`](tokio::task::JoinHandle)s**. A
//! run settles itself and its guard reaps the entry; the supervisor never needs
//! to abort a task, and holding join handles would mean deciding who reaps a run
//! nobody is waiting on. The shape is the one
//! [`InflightRegistry`](crate::company::steer::InflightRegistry) already uses
//! for steerable turns, for the same RAII reason.
//!
//! It is also **not** how a host that dies mid-run is cleaned up. That is
//! already solved: a dead host's runs are settled at the next boot by
//! [`sweep_interrupted_runs`](super::sweep_interrupted_runs), which needs no
//! help from an in-memory map (and could not get any — the map dies with the
//! process). This module adds no sweep of its own.
//!
//! ## The map is also the read side's liveness proof (issue #1009)
//!
//! [`live`](RunSupervisor::live) started life as a diagnostic. It is now load
//! bearing. `GET …/workflows/runs` folds a start with no finish as
//! `running: true`, and cross-checks that claim against this map: a run the map
//! does not hold, whose finish is nowhere in the journal, is one that died
//! without journaling, and the read settles it rather than serving a spinner
//! that would otherwise last until the next restart. Two properties of `begin`
//! and [`RunGuard`] are what make that inference sound, and both have to survive
//! any future change here:
//!
//! * `begin` registers **before** the run's task is spawned, and therefore
//!   before the runner journals the run's `WorkflowRunStarted`. So a start in
//!   the journal implies the run *was* registered — there is no window in which
//!   a run is visibly started but not yet addressable.
//! * the guard is dropped **after** the outcome is journaled — by the watchdog
//!   in [`WorkflowSpawn::spawn_admitted`](crate::runtime::WorkflowSpawn), which holds it
//!   across the normal and the abnormal path alike. So a run that has left this
//!   map has already written its finish, if it was ever going to write one.
//!
//! That second property is also what closed this module's other long-standing
//! gap: a **panicking** run task used to unwind past its own journal write, so
//! its guard dropped and nothing recorded the run at all. The watchdog now
//! journals [`RUN_TASK_LOST`](crate::runtime::RUN_TASK_LOST) for it.
//!
//! ## One known gap, inherited rather than introduced
//!
//! A live runtime swap ([`rebuild_company`](super::rebuild_company)) gives the
//! successor runtime a fresh supervisor, so a run registered on the old one can
//! no longer be cancelled (it still finishes and still journals). This matches
//! how the steer registry behaves across a rebuild — see
//! [`RuntimeHandover`](super::RuntimeHandover) — and cancelling is a
//! best-effort operator convenience, not a correctness guarantee.

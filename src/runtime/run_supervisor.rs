//! Issue #383: the live set of workflow runs an operator can still stop.
//!
//! A run used to be reachable only as an in-flight HTTP request. Nothing held a
//! handle to it, so there was nowhere to send "stop" — which is why the issue is
//! *both* halves at once: a run has to be addressable while it is running before
//! it can be cancellable at all.
//!
//! [`RunSupervisor`] is that address book. [`begin`](RunSupervisor::begin) mints
//! the run's [`WorkflowRunContext`] — the same context, carrying the same
//! `run_id` issue #371 already correlates progress events on, so **no second
//! identifier is introduced** — and registers its [`RunCancel`] handle;
//! [`cancel`](RunSupervisor::cancel) fires that handle;
//! [`RunGuard`]'s `Drop` deregisters the entry on every exit path.
//!
//! ## What it holds, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! It holds **cancel handles, not [`JoinHandle`](tokio::task::JoinHandle)s**. A
//! run settles itself and its guard reaps the entry; the supervisor never needs
//! to abort a task, and holding join handles would mean deciding who reaps a run
//! nobody is waiting on. The shape is the one
//! [`InflightRegistry`](crate::company::steer::InflightRegistry) already uses
//! for steerable turns, for the same RAII reason.
//!
//! It is also **not** how a host that dies mid-run is cleaned up. That is
//! already solved: a dead host's runs are settled at the next boot by
//! [`sweep_interrupted_runs`](super::sweep_interrupted_runs), which needs no
//! help from an in-memory map (and could not get any — the map dies with the
//! process). This module adds no sweep of its own.
//!
//! ## Two known gaps, both inherited rather than introduced
//!
//! * A **panicking** run task unwinds, so its guard drops and the entry goes —
//!   but nothing journals a `WorkflowRunFinished`, so the run reads
//!   `running: true` in `GET …/workflows/runs` until the next restart sweeps it.
//!   That is the same exposure #371 accepted for a run whose journal append
//!   failed, and the same remedy settles both.
//! * A live runtime swap ([`rebuild_company`](super::rebuild_company)) gives the
//!   successor runtime a fresh supervisor, so a run registered on the old one
//!   can no longer be cancelled (it still finishes and still journals). This
//!   matches how the steer registry behaves across a rebuild — see
//!   [`RuntimeHandover`](super::RuntimeHandover) — and cancelling is a
//!   best-effort operator convenience, not a correctness guarantee.

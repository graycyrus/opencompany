//! CortexDB HTTP adapter — a standalone memory service reached over the
//! `remote` driver seam (issue: CortexDB as a memory engine).
//!
//! CortexDB is not one of the three engines `tinymemory-remote` ships a
//! dialect for, and its adapters (`Dialect`, `RemoteMemory`, `HttpClient`,
//! `StoredEntry`, …) are `pub(crate)` to that crate — unreachable from here.
//! So this module implements [`Memory`] directly over `reqwest`, the same
//! contract the vendored adapters implement, rather than extending a type this
//! crate cannot see.
//!
//! # Wire shape
//!
//! CortexDB has no notion of a `(namespace, key)` record. It is an
//! event-sourced store: writes are `POST /v1/experience` envelopes filed under
//! a hierarchical `scope` string, and reads are `POST /v1/recall`, which runs
//! retrieval (BM25 + vector + optional graph) and returns hits grouped by
//! layer (`events`, `episodes`, `facts`, `beliefs`, `understanding`).
//!
//! The mapping this driver uses:
//!
//! - **Scope.** A tinymemory `namespace` string already carries this host's
//!   own tenant isolation (see `super::namespace` — every namespace is rooted
//!   at a per-company hash). This driver hashes that namespace again into a
//!   CortexDB scope segment (`org:opencompany/ns:<hex>`), so two companies —
//!   or two namespaces within one company — never share a CortexDB scope and
//!   therefore never share recall.
//! - **Identity.** `(namespace, key)` and the tinymemory bookkeeping
//!   (`category`, `session_id`, `taint`) travel as a JSON envelope
//!   (`Content::Json`), not as prose, so nothing here asks CortexDB's
//!   extraction pipeline to preserve them faithfully. `view=raw` recall reads
//!   events verbatim, which is what this driver always asks for.
//! - **Idempotency.** The write key is a hash of `(namespace, key, content)`.
//!   Storing the same content under the same key twice is therefore a no-op
//!   replay (matching [`Memory::store`]'s own idempotence), while a changed
//!   `content` mints a new event. CortexDB is bi-temporal and keeps history by
//!   design; this driver's read side (`get`/`list`/`recall`) treats the
//!   *most recently observed* event for a key as the one upsert semantics
//!   promise, which is the honest way to present an event log through a
//!   key-value contract.
//! - **Forget.** `POST /v1/forget` retracts derived layers reliably; whether
//!   it can also retract raw events is a CortexDB-side policy this driver does
//!   not control. `forget` asks for every layer and reports what the server
//!   says it removed — see [`CortexdbMemory::forget`] for the caveat.
//!
//! # Auth
//!
//! Every request carries `Authorization: Bearer <token>` **and**
//! `X-Cortex-Actor: <actor>`. CortexDB treats a mismatch between the token's
//! subject and the actor header as a hard `401`, so both travel on every call,
//! always.

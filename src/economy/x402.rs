//! x402 payment challenges and Ed25519-signed authorizations.
//!
//! When a counterparty gates a skill behind payment it answers `402` with a
//! challenge naming the `amount`, `recipient`, `asset`, and `network`. The payer
//! signs an **authorization** over a canonical payload with the same Ed25519
//! identity key it uses for SIWX, then posts it to the settlement endpoints.
//! This module only *builds and verifies* authorizations — no on-chain
//! submission happens here (that is a documented SDK gap).
//!
//! ## Canonical byte layout (golden, versioned)
//!
//! ```text
//! tiny.place-x402-v1\n
//! <agentId>\n
//! <amount>\n
//! <recipient>\n
//! <asset>\n
//! <network>\n
//! <nonce>\n
//! <timestamp>
//! ```
//!
//! Isolated in [`canonical_bytes`] so it is a one-function change to reconcile
//! with the real tiny.place server when reachable.
//!
//! ## Single use is enforced, not merely documented
//!
//! The signature covers the whole payload including the nonce, so a payer
//! cannot re-point one authorization at different work — but nothing about a
//! signature stops the *same* authorization being presented again. [`verify`]
//! therefore takes the spent-nonce set and the current time, and refuses both a
//! nonce it has already seen and an authorization older than
//! [`MAX_AGE_SECS`]. Neither is optional, because a verified-but-unspent
//! authorization is a bearer token: one signature buying unlimited work.
//!
//! Bounding acceptance by age is what makes forgetting a nonce safe. The spent
//! set prunes on the same constant, so a nonce is dropped only once the
//! authorization carrying it would be refused on age anyway, and there is no
//! window in which a replay outlives the memory of it.
//!
//! ## The nonce comes from the OS CSPRNG
//!
//! The nonce is signed into the payload above, so a counterparty's replay check
//! is only as good as the value's unpredictability and uniqueness. It is
//! therefore minted by [`mint_nonce`] from 256 bits of OS randomness through
//! the same
//! [`TokenSource`](crate::server::users::token::TokenSource) seam the user-auth
//! secrets use — **not** from
//! [`generate_id`](crate::ports::generate_id), whose epoch-millis-plus-counter
//! shape is guessable from a prior value and repeats across processes that
//! start in the same millisecond.

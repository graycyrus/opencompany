//! What an ACP session *is*, on this host.
//!
//! ACP gives a session an opaque id, a `cwd` and a set of MCP servers. None of
//! those mean here what they mean for a local harness, and the translation is
//! where the interesting decisions are.
//!
//! A session is the triple **(company, thread, optional agent)**. The thread
//! the turns land in is the desk the client asked for, or — when the client
//! pins the session to a roster member — that member's DM channel
//! (`dm:<member>`, the one chat key the cycle's routing resolves to that
//! member). Either way an ACP client and the web console looking at the same
//! thread see the same conversation, which is the whole reason to reuse the
//! thread rather than invent a parallel one.

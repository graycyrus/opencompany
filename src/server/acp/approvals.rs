//! Approvals, outbound: this host does **not** implement
//! `session/request_permission`.
//!
//! ACP's permission model assumes a turn that *suspends*: the agent asks, the
//! client answers, the same tool call proceeds. This host's approvals do not
//! work that way, and the difference is structural rather than a matter of
//! plumbing.
//!
//! Read `harness/policy.rs`. OpenHuman resolves `RequireApproval` **fail-closed
//! and inline**: it blocks the call and feeds the model a refusal string. *The
//! call is gone.* There is no suspended continuation to resume. The projected
//! effect is parked after the turn, the turn completes with a reply, and a
//! human later resolves it — which mints a single-use grant and **re-dispatches
//! the agent**. That is a new turn.
//!
//! So by the time an approval exists to ask about, `session/prompt` has already
//! returned its `stopReason`. There is no point at which a blocking
//! `session/request_permission` could be issued, and implementing one would
//! mean it either never fires or fires against a turn that has ended.
//!
//! Instead a park is surfaced as a session-level notification carrying the
//! approval id ([`parked_notification`]), and the client resolves it over the
//! existing REST surface — which the desktop already has, because it runs the
//! same console.
//!
//! ## Inbound is a separate, already-answered question
//!
//! When this host is the ACP **client** — `src-tauri/src/acp/client.rs`
//! driving a locally-installed harness — an inbound `session/request_permission`
//! is answered synchronously by a `ClientHandler` implementation there, not
//! held for a human. `LocalAcpAgent`'s production handler (`AutoApprovingFiles`)
//! trusts the harness's own permission-mode config and auto-approves whatever
//! it still asks about; there is no queued, human-in-the-loop path on that
//! side today. A held-request TTL is meaningless without something that ever
//! holds a request, so this module carries none.

//! The console side of the TinyHumans key grant: the PKCE secret, and the
//! flows waiting on one.
//!
//! An admin clicks "Connect TinyHumans"; the browser goes to the hub, signs in,
//! approves; and the console comes back holding a one-time `code`. This module
//! owns the half of that exchange the browser never sees.
//!
//! ## Why the verifier lives here and not in the browser
//!
//! PKCE would work either way — the console could mint its own verifier, keep
//! it in `sessionStorage`, and send it up with the code. It does not, for one
//! reason: whoever holds the verifier can redeem the code, and whatever redeems
//! the code receives the **key**. Putting the verifier in the browser would mean
//! the browser redeems, which means a TinyHumans key with `connections` on it
//! passes through a tab, a `fetch` response, and whatever a devtools panel or an
//! extension makes of both — on its way to being sent straight back down to the
//! host that needed it.
//!
//! So the host mints the verifier, keeps it, and hands the browser only an
//! opaque `state`. The browser's whole job is to carry `state` out and `code`
//! back. The key is minted, stored, and forgotten without ever being
//! serialized towards a client.
//!
//! ## Why it is in memory
//!
//! A pending link is worth less than a minute of anyone's time: if the process
//! restarts mid-flow the button simply has to be clicked again. Writing the
//! verifier to the secret store would mean a durable record of a live secret
//! whose entire purpose is to stop existing, and a sweep to delete it. The
//! `oauth_pending` map for MCP (issue #90) parks its `code_verifier` the same
//! way and for the same reason.

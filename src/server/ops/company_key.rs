//! The company's own TinyHumans credential, over HTTP (issue #586): read whether
//! one is set and which identity brokered calls currently present, and set /
//! rotate / clear it.
//!
//! The credential itself is [`company_key`](crate::company::company_key); this
//! is its console plane. **Write-only**: the key goes in through the `key`
//! field, lands in the secret store, and is never echoed — the read shape
//! carries only a `configured` boolean plus the non-secret tier name.
//!
//! **Admin-only** on the write, for the same reason
//! [`ops::composio`](super::composio)'s token write is: this key is the identity
//! every one of the company's agents presents to every surface the platform
//! brokers, and it is the company's wallet — whoever sets it decides which
//! account those agents act through and which account pays. That is a decision
//! made *for* the company, not a member's own, and [`AdminScopedCompany`] is
//! what says so in the signature.
//!
//! A set / rotate / clear takes effect on the agents' **next cycle** with no
//! restart: every surface **wired to this credential** re-resolves through
//! [`company_key::resolve`](crate::company::company_key::resolve) and the roster
//! fingerprint moves with the key's value. That is Composio today; inference and
//! embeddings still resolve from the environment (#585), so "wired to it" is a
//! smaller set than "brokered" until that lands.

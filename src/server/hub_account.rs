//! Where a person goes to look after the TinyHumans account behind a company's
//! key: the page that mints and revokes keys, and the one that tops up the
//! balance those keys spend.
//!
//! The console can mint a key without anyone leaving it ([`hub_link`] and
//! `ops::company_key`), but two things it deliberately cannot do are *revoke*
//! one and *pay* for what it spends. Both live on the hub's own dashboard,
//! behind that person's own sign-in, which is the right place for them: one
//! ends an instance's access and the other moves money.
//!
//! So the console does not reimplement either. It links to them — and the whole
//! job of this module is to work out **which** hub's dashboard, so a console
//! pointed at staging never sends an operator to production's billing page to
//! wonder why the balance they topped up did not arrive.
//!
//! ## Why the web address is derived from the API address
//!
//! A deployment already names its hub once, as `TINYHUMANS_API_URL`. Asking it
//! to name the matching site a second time is a chance to disagree — and the
//! disagreement is silent, because a link that opens the wrong environment
//! looks exactly like a link that opens the right one. So the site is derived
//! from the API address by the naming convention the ecosystem actually uses:
//!
//! | API base | Site |
//! |---|---|
//! | `https://api.tinyhumans.ai` | `https://tinyhumans.ai` |
//! | `https://staging-api.tinyhumans.ai` | `https://staging.tinyhumans.ai` |
//!
//! [`TINYHUMANS_WEB_URL`](crate::app::config::WEB_URL_ENV) overrides the
//! derivation for a deployment whose site does not follow it — a preview
//! build, a local Next.js dev server, a white-labelled front end.
//!
//! An address the convention does not recognize derives **nothing**. A guess
//! would be a link to a host that may not exist, and the console renders no
//! link at all rather than one that 404s, which is the same rule
//! `hub_link: false` follows for the button.
//!
//! [`hub_link`]: crate::server::hub_link

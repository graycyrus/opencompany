//! Learning which ecosystem address is behind a platform token.
//!
//! Sign-in happens **here**, on the company's own console. The browser is sent
//! to the hub's OAuth start pointed back at this origin, the hub completes the
//! provider dance and redirects back carrying a platform JWT, and this module
//! turns that JWT into one address.
//!
//! ## Why this tenant does not verify the token
//!
//! It cannot. The signing secret belongs to the hub, and handing it to every
//! tenant so each could check a signature would also let every tenant *mint* a
//! token for any user in the ecosystem — the plainest possible way to lose the
//! isolation the hosting layer exists to provide.
//!
//! So the tenant does not verify the token; it *uses* it. It presents the token
//! to the hub's own `GET /auth/me`, exactly as the dashboard would. If the hub
//! answers with an identity, that **is** the proof: only the hub can say who a
//! token it signed belongs to, and a forged or expired one gets a 401 there.
//! No shared secret, no minted code, no second round trip to invent.
//!
//! ## What this costs, stated plainly
//!
//! The tenant briefly holds a hub credential belonging to the person signing
//! in — one that carries their ecosystem privileges, not merely their identity.
//! That is a real delegation of trust to the tenant, and it is strictly more
//! than a single-use, slug-bound code would have handed over. It is accepted
//! here because the console *is* the company: a person signing in to their own
//! company's host is already trusting that host with everything the company
//! holds. What this module owes in return is discipline — the token is used
//! once, for one request, and is never persisted, never logged, and never
//! echoed back in an error.
//!
//! Authorization is emphatically **not** delegated. The hub says who they are;
//! this company's own roster says whether they may in — the same
//! `eligibility` → `upsert_from_eligibility` → `mint_session` path a magic link
//! answers to.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! The [`HubIdentityExchange`] trait and its offline [`MockHubIdentityExchange`]
//! compile in the default build, so the whole route — eligibility, session
//! minting, every refusal — is exercised without linking a network crate. Only
//! [`HttpHubIdentityExchange`] is gated behind the existing `tinyhumans`
//! feature, which is already what "this instance talks to the hub about its
//! credential's owner" means. It does not earn a feature flag of its own.

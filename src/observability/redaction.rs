//! Removing credentials from text on its way out of the process.
//!
//! Applied to every string a crash report can carry — the event message, the
//! log entry, each exception value, each breadcrumb, and every string leaf of
//! the structured fields a `tracing` event brings with it
//! (`docs/spec/runtime/crash-reporting.md`).
//!
//! # Why this file is not behind the feature
//!
//! It names no `sentry::` type and it is the part that has to be right, so it
//! compiles and is tested in every build — including the default one, where a
//! `crash-reporting` lane would never run it. That is the same argument
//! `analytics::config` makes for the enable/disable decision, and it is the
//! reason the `crash-reporting` feature is a *second* gate rather than the only
//! one.
//!
//! # Why it is hand-written rather than a set of regexes
//!
//! The vendored runtime's equivalent (`core::log_redaction`) is seven regexes,
//! and its scars are instructive: `token[=:\s]+\S+` matched
//! `cancellation_token=` and `next_page_token=` until a `\b` was added, and the
//! generic `sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}` left a trailing `_uv` behind on any key with a
//! separator in it until the character class grew.
//!
//! Both failures are the same failure — a regex over raw text has no idea where
//! a *word* begins and ends — so this splits the text into tokens first and
//! asks its questions of whole tokens. `cancellation_token` is one token and
//! normalises to `cancellationtoken`, which is not a secret-bearing key, so the
//! false positive cannot arise rather than being patched out of it. A secret
//! with a separator inside is one token, so there is no fragment to leave
//! behind.
//!
//! It also avoids making `regex` an unconditional dependency of this crate. It
//! is optional today (`Cargo.toml`, under `openhuman`), and a security control
//! that must run in every build cannot be built on a crate that does not.
//!
//! # What this is and is not
//!
//! It is a **last line of defence**, not the first. The first is not putting a
//! credential in a message: `SecretValue` (`ports::types`) exists so a
//! credential is not `Display`, and `analytics::config::ProjectToken` and
//! [`super::config::Dsn`] both refuse to `Debug` themselves. A scrubber is
//! heuristic by construction — it cannot recognise a secret that looks like a
//! word — so a call site that relies on it is one release away from leaking.

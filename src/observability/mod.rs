//! Crash and error reporting to a Sentry project the **operator** owns.
//!
//! `docs/spec/runtime/crash-reporting.md` is the contract; this is the wiring.
//! Nothing here reports anything until an operator sets
//! [`config::DSN_ENV`], and a build compiled without the `crash-reporting`
//! feature contains no client that could.
//!
//! # The compile-time domain gate
//!
//! The shape is the vendored runtime's, deliberately — same feature name,
//! same carve-out (`vendor/openhuman/Cargo.toml`, "TYPE CARVE-OUT"). Every
//! function in this module is compiled in **both** builds with the **same
//! signature**; only the bodies that name a `sentry::` type are gated. So:
//!
//! * [`tracing_layer`] returns a no-op [`Identity`] layer rather than nothing,
//!   and the subscriber that adds it needs no `#[cfg]`;
//! * [`scope::identify`] keeps its `tracing::debug!` and drops the scope call;
//! * [`init`] still resolves the decision, and reports it as
//!   [`config::Silence::NotCompiled`] when a DSN was configured but this binary
//!   has nothing to install — which is the line an operator needs, because
//!   "reporting to …" would be the opposite of the truth;
//! * `opencompany sentry-test` still exists and says which build it is, rather
//!   than looking like a subcommand that was never added.
//!
//! There is therefore no stub file and no `#[cfg]` at a call site, which is the
//! whole point: a gate that spreads into its callers gets one of them wrong.
//!
//! [`Identity`]: tracing_subscriber::layer::Identity

///
/// A tower `Layer` cannot be returned as `impl Layer` from two `#[cfg]`
/// branches without also naming every bound `Router::layer` puts on the

/// inside one function, so the call site in `server::routes` needs no `#[cfg]`
/// — the same rule the rest of this module follows.
///
/// # Why it checks first
///
/// The layers are added **only** when this process is actually recording
/// transactions. With tracing off — the default, and what every install that
/// sets nothing but a DSN gets — the router is returned untouched, so a feature
/// nobody asked for costs nothing on the request path. That check has to happen
/// here rather than at `init`, because the router is built later; it reads the
/// live client's options, which is the same thing the sampler will read.

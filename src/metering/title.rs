//! Emitting [`SampleKind::TitleCall`] usage samples — what naming a card costs,
//! and who it is charged to.
//!
//! # Why this is not a teammate's inference
//!
//! A titling pass is the tool-less model call that turns a request into a card's
//! headline. It happens while the card is being opened, before it has been
//! handed to anybody, so there is no agent to attribute it to. Like a triage
//! escalation and a responder selection, it is charged to the whole-company
//! bucket ([`UNATTRIBUTED_AGENT`]) with no `run_id`.
//!
//! It is deliberately not folded into
//! [`SampleKind::TriageCall`](crate::ports::usage::SampleKind). Triage runs on
//! every message the lexical layer abstained on; titling runs only on the ones
//! that become cards. Sharing a kind would make the triage line item move
//! whenever the board got busier, and neither number could be tuned against the
//! other.
//!
//! # Both writes are logged and swallowed
//!
//! Same rule as the triage and selector paths: the card has already been named
//! and the operator's turn is already running by the time this is called. A
//! ledger or meter hiccup must cost the accounting row and never the card. The
//! tokens were genuinely spent either way, which is why the failure is logged
//! rather than silently dropped.

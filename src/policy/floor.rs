//! The consequence floor: which calls commit the company, and would stop for a
//! human whatever tier the company runs (issue #2147, epic #1817).
//!
//! ## What this module is for
//!
//! Since #1925 no policy classification creates an approval request in
//! production: [`ApprovalPolicy::check`](crate::harness::policy::ApprovalPolicy)
//! returns `Allow` before `always_approve`, the daily cap, the tier dispatch and
//! [`judge`](crate::policy::judge), and the roster build disables policy HITL on
//! both the tool path and the native-effect gate. Whether an outward,
//! irreversible act reaches a person is therefore decided by the agent choosing
//! to call `request_approval`.
//!
//! Epic #1817 asks for that decision to be enforced again, on **consequence**
//! rather than on which tool was reached for. Before proposing to enforce
//! anything, #2147 measures: this module owns the predicate, and a shadow
//! reader records what it *would* have stopped without changing any decision.
//!
//! ## One implementation, not two
//!
//! The predicate is not new behaviour invented here — it is the pair of
//! consequence arms [`judge`] already applies, lifted out so the shadow reader
//! and `judge` cannot drift. [`always_approve`](crate::policy::always_approve)
//! exists because that drift already happened once (#684: one operator list,
//! two matchers, two answers). `judge` calls [`evaluate`] with no cap, which is
//! exactly its previous behaviour; the shadow reader calls it with the
//! company's cap.
//!
//! ## What the floor deliberately does not cover
//!
//! `judge`'s other two arms — an undeclared tool, and a declared tool whose
//! reach is unbounded — stop on *mechanism*: `shell` stops for `ls`, and a tool
//! stops for being unrecognised. That is the interruption #1925 removed, and
//! re-proposing it under a new name would earn the same rejection. They stay in
//! `judge` and are not part of the floor.
//!
//! [`DEFERRED`] is likewise honoured rather than quietly reversed: #658 ruled
//! that a `full` company publishes its own artifact unattended. A shadow reader
//! that silently counted it would be measuring a rule nobody has agreed to, so
//! [`deferred_group`] reports it on its own axis instead — the cost of that
//! carve-out becomes visible without this module pre-judging it.

//! Per-call judgement: which calls stop for a human, beyond what the static
//! configuration says (issue #338, spine epic #183 §4).
//!
//! Specified in `docs/spec/company-brain/per-call-judgement.md`.
//!
//! # The gap this fills
//!
//! Whether a call stops is answered entirely by configuration decided before
//! the run starts: reserved `never_do`, the `readonly` brake, a live grant,
//! `always_approve`, the daily cap, `auto_approve_under_usd`, then the mode.
//! Nothing looks at what the run is about to do.
//!
//! That is a bad trade in both directions. Set the bar low and every run stops
//! constantly, which is the batching pressure #183 decision 3 exists to avoid.
//! Set it high — `full` — and an agent-picked call can send, pay, delete or
//! otherwise reach beyond a boundary this layer can see without asking anyone.
//! Publishing is the deliberate #658 exception described below.
//!
//! `full`'s stated contract is "the agents act without asking, **except the few
//! things on the always-ask list**". Without this module that exception is
//! whatever one operator remembered to type into `always_approve`. With it, the
//! irreversible acts stop on their own merits.
//!
//! # This can only ever ADD a stop
//!
//! The single most important property here, and the one the tests pin. This is
//! consulted **only where the rest of the chain has already decided to allow**,
//! and its only possible answers are "stop" and "say nothing". It cannot
//! un-deny a `readonly` refusal, cannot skip `always_approve`, cannot spend a
//! grant, and cannot soften the reserved `never_do` slot. Static configuration
//! stays authoritative everywhere it speaks; this speaks only in the silence
//! after it.
//!
//! The invariant, phrased so it survives the next tier: **this arm only ever
//! speaks where the mode allowed.** A tier that already parks or denies a call
//! keeps its own answer, whatever the tier is called and however many there
//! are.
//!
//! Which tiers that leaves the arm speaking on is deliberately **not
//! enumerated** — not here, not in [`crate::harness::policy`], and not in the
//! spec. A prose tier list is a copy to miss the next time a tier lands, and
//! `auto` (issue #560) landing mid-review is the proof that they land. The
//! question is answered instead by the one copy that cannot go stale:
//! `the_arm_adds_nothing_under_auto` walks **every declared tool** and asserts
//! this arm is silent on each one a tier still allows — so a new tier or a new
//! declaration fails a test rather than outdating a paragraph.
//!
//! # Where the classification lives
//!
//! The issue asks whether this is a property of the tool definition or a runtime
//! judgement per candidate call. It is a **hybrid**, and deliberately not the
//! third option:
//!
//! - **Declared**, from [`crate::policy::consequence`]'s table — the same
//!   declaration the approval card and the standing-grant rule already read. No
//!   new column and no second taxonomy: a second list would drift against the
//!   first, and the drift would be silent in the safe-looking direction.
//! - **Runtime**, from the arguments of the actual call — a `composio_execute`
//!   slug that names a send, or a declared amount of money. Deterministic
//!   inspection, not inference.
//! - **Not a model call.** A classifier LLM on the approval path costs money and
//!   latency per candidate call, is itself an external effect being made to
//!   decide whether external effects are allowed, and — fatally — returns a
//!   different verdict on different days. "Why did it stop?" must have an
//!   answer that can be re-derived from the record months later, which #242's
//!   trace exists to make possible. A sampled verdict cannot be audited.
//!
//! # It does not learn
//!
//! Firmly, and not as an oversight. If an operator approves the same shape of
//! call five times, the sixth still stops. Consent is an operator writing a
//! rule — that is issue #563, and a rule is a thing they can read, revoke and
//! be shown. A classifier noticing a habit is not consent: nobody agreed to it,
//! it cannot be pointed at, and it converts a security boundary into a
//! frequency count. The two mechanisms must not converge, so this one holds no
//! state across calls at all.
//!
//! That is also why **novelty is not a signal here**, though #338 lists it.
//! Every use of "we have seen this before" makes the gate *looser*, and a
//! looser second call is precisely what #243's single-use grant already governs:
//! the operator approves one call, redeeming it consumes it, and the next
//! identical call parks again. A novelty rule that skipped the second stop would
//! quietly repeal that. It is recorded as a signal on the trace instead, where
//! it informs a human without deciding anything.
//!
//! # Which path a call arrives on decides whether this speaks at all
//!
//! Issue #674's ruling, and the reason this module takes a [`CallPath`] rather
//! than judging every call the same way.
//!
//! A workflow `tool_call` node is **refused at author time** unless its
//! namespace is one the workflow invoker wires *and* the company's
//! `[tools].allow` grants it. So a saved `shell` node has already passed **two
//! operator gates** — the manifest grant, then authoring — and the operator has
//! seen the actual command they saved.
//!
//! An agent turn has passed **neither**. The model picks the tool and the
//! arguments at run time. That is a real difference in what the operator
//! consented to, which is why `full` meaning "do not ask me about what I
//! authored" is coherent while "do not ask me about anything the model decides
//! to run" is not.
//!
//! So: **#338's rules govern [`CallPath::Agent`]. #614's position governs
//! [`CallPath::AuthoredWorkflowNode`]** — on that path this module is silent,
//! and the operator's controls are the two gates above plus `always_approve`,
//! which still gates a node the tier would allow.
//!
//! ## The boundary condition, without which the split is a hole
//!
//! **A node whose arguments are templated from an upstream node's output is not
//! pre-declared**, and follows the *agent* rule. The operator declared the
//! *shape*; the *content* arrives at run time from data they never saw.
//!
//! Without this the split is trivially defeated: author one `shell` node whose
//! `command` is `=previous.output` and the two-gate argument stops describing
//! what actually runs. See [`any_argument_is_templated`].
//!
//! # What this deliberately does NOT stop
//!
//! #338's acceptance says "send, publish, pay, or delete". Read against the
//! split above: on the agent path **send, pay and delete are gated and publish
//! is not**; on the authored-node path none of the four are gated here unless
//! the boundary condition returns the node to the agent rule.
//!
//! `publish_artifact` is carved out on **both** paths, permanently — see
//! `DEFERRED` and issue #658.
//!
//! `shell` stays gated on the agent path, which is what keeps "or delete" real:
//! destruction has no `EffectGroup` of its own, and `shell` is how a run
//! deletes.
//!
//! # Failure is a stop
//!
//! There is no "unclassified, so allow" path. A tool nobody declared stops
//! ([`StopReason::Undeclared`]) unless `consequence_of` can see from its name
//! that it only reads, and a Composio slug nobody classified is already treated
//! as a send by the catalogue's own cautious fallback.
//!
//! The undeclared case gets its **own** reason rather than borrowing the group
//! one, because for an undeclared tool the group is a guess made from words in
//! the name. That guess is good enough to label a card and not good enough to
//! justify a stop to an operator: `write_file` contains "file", so the guess is
//! `Sign`, and "signs or files a document" is a confident false statement about
//! a file write. The call stops either way; only the sentence differs, and the
//! sentence is what a human reads.
